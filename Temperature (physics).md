# What?
- The quantitative "Temperature" ($T$) is thought of by humans as a way to communicate how hot or cold something is compared to a reference value.
- The "degrees" (the number measured by a thermometer) is actually the [[internal kinetic energy]] of an object - or how fast the molecules are moving inside a substance.
	- The faster the molecules move, the hotter it is.
	- The slower the molecules move, the colder it is.
- Temperatures can be measured with 3 different scales: Kelvin, Celsius and Fahrenheit.
	- Kelvin is the [[SI unit]] for Temperature

# Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT)
- Higher temperature corresponds to faster-moving particles.

# Temperature Relationship to [[internal kinetic energy]]
- Higher temperature corresponds to higher internal energy ($U$).

# Units
> [!hint] Absolute Zero
> **0 Kelvin** is also known as *Absolute Zero,* which is equivalent to -273.15°C.

> [!hint] Boiling Point
> We can reference the boiling point of water at 100°C, 212°F, or 373 K.

## Kelvin
![[Pasted image 20221019102927.png|350]]
- The Kelvin Scale is based on the kinetic-molecule theory that says as kinetic energy increases, so does the temperature.
	- When the particles in a substance have the no kinetic energy, it has **0 Kelvin.**
- The Kelvin scale uses the Celsius degree unit - a unit that is equal in size to the Celsius scale.
- There is no degree symbol before the letter "K." So, when referring to the Celsius or Fahrenheit scale, we would need to refer to it as "degrees Celsius" or "degrees Fahrenheit." But when working with Kelvin, we just says: "Kelvin."
## Fahrenheit

### Backstory
- A Dutch-German physicist named Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit proposed the **Fahrenheit scale** in 1724.
- One story suggests he used the coldest temperature ever recorded in his hometown as the zero-degree mark. He later used a mixture of brine (salt and water) and ice to determine that zero mark.

### The purpose of the Fahrenheit Scale
Daniel tried to make the math a little easier and the number of degrees more granular to get more specific quantifiable results.

## Celsius

> [!faq] Why is the Celsius Scale sometime called the centigrade scale?
> Because there are exactly 100 degrees between the freezing point and boiling point of water, with 0°C being the freezing point of water.

### Backstory
Water was the main reference for creation of the scale by Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius.

## Converting Between Units
### Fahrenheit to Celsius:
#### $$T_C = \frac{5}{9}(T_F-32)$$
### Celsius to Fahrenheit:
#### $$T_F = \frac{9}{5}(T_C) + 32$$
### Celsius to Kelvin:
#### $$T_K = T_C + 273.15$$
### Kelvin to Celsius:
#### $$T_C = T_K - 273.15$$
### Fahrenheit to Kelvin or Kelvin to Fahrenheit
- Convert the first unit to Celsius, then, from Celsius convert to the second unit.
