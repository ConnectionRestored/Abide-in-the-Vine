# Measuring Simple harmonic motion

#### Some technical terms 
- A **period** is the time its take for a pendulum to complete one "back and forth" cycle ($T$) and is measured in seconds.
- **Frequencies** is the time for one cycle, vibration, or oscillation ($f$) and is measured in Hertz (equivalent to $\frac{1}{s}$).
- **Amplitude** is the maximum distance from the equilibrium.
	- Because in a pendulum, the path is a semi-circle, the amplitude is measured in radians.
	- For a mass-spring system, the amplitude is measured in meters.

> **Important**
>Period is seconds per cycle and Frequency is cycles per second.
>Thus, $T = \frac{1}{f}$ and $f = \frac{1}{T}$ #formula

$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$
Where:
- $L$ is the pendulum length (m)
- $g$ is the acceleration of gravity.

#### Calculating the period of a mass-spring #formula 
$$T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$
Where:
- $k$ is the spring constant of the spring
