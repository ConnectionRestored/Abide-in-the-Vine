# What?
- Heat ($Q$) is energy that moves from **higher temperatures to lower temperatures**.
	- When something is hot, it has lots of kinetic energy. That kinetic energy transfers to its surrounding, decreasing that object's overall energy (thus its temperature) while increasing its surrounding's energy (thus the surrounding's temperature).
- Heat is measured in *Joules* ($J$).

# Transfer of Heat
## Formula
- [[The Law of Conservation of Energy]] applies, which means the total energy is conserved when heat is transferred from one substance to the next.
#### $$Q_{\text{gained}} + Q_\text{lost} = 0$$
## Ways that heat can transfer
### Conduction
- Conduction happens when heat moves through materials that are **touching** one another.
- Conduction is the main way heat is transferred in **solids**.
- Real-life example of a pan on a stove: The heat energy from the stove is transferred to the molecules of the pan, making it move faster and faster with those nearest the heat source bump to those around them. Those molecules then bump into other molecules, and the heat spread throughout the pan. 
### Convection
- Convection happens when liquid or air **currents** transfer energy and moves from place to place (Example: radiators)
- Convection only occur in fluids (either gases or liquids). It can't occur in solid, for convection depends on the movement of the entire substance.
- Theoretical example: When a part of a liquid or gas warms up (the part closest to the heat source), the molecules there move around faster and the that part expands. This makes that part of the liquid to become hotter and less dense, so it rises. As the warmer liquid rises, the cooler and more dense liquid sinks. A *convection current* is produced until all of the liquid is hot and the current disappears.
### Radiation
- Radiation happens when heat is transferred by [[Electromagnetic Waves (physics)]] and  **no matter is needed** for it to travel from one place to the next (Example: sun, fire, toasters...).
- Real-life example of a toaster: The coils in a toaster can heat up the air around then through convection, but the main transfer of heat is actually through radiation. You can actually see evidence of this because as the coils get brighter, they put off more energy (or get warmer). The toast is toasted by the radiation coming from the coils.
