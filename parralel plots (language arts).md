### #Definition
- Parallel plots are stories of equal importance happening to different characters or in different settings, all within the same narrative framework.
	- Example: In a novel with parallel plots, multiple characters are developed simultaneously. Each character has a storyline, and the author weaves the stories together in a way that (hopefully) works.
