# Parenting
- Model: Shepherding a Child's Heart. [[Tedd Tripp]]
	- Shepherding != Teaching, molding.

[[Prov 4#23]]
- True for us, VERY TRUE for our children.
- If we learn from the Bible, our children will learn biblical values.

> [!quote] Values
> We want our children to be successful. But what does that mean? To have a good job? To be happy? To have a nice family? To have many awards? Different people can have different wishes and values, however, do these wishes line up with what the world values or with what God values. 

- Many people wants to have children that behave well.
	- Our heart: Do you want your child to behave to make you look good, or do you want him/her to please God?
	- Teach the HEART, not the HEAD.
	- Know WHY childrens act the way they do.
- Children education
	- We push education on our children. But, do education bring success? What about values?
		- The study culture is not godly! We send our children into a very ungodly culture to have education.
			- Money > Faith?
			- Success > Character?
	- Know our children: most importantly, their relationship with the Lord.
		- Sad fact: about 50% of children going into collage abandon their faith.
	- Judge the environment: will it point my child to the Lord?
- Our children's relationship with God
	- Encourge them to pray and ask Jesus for forgiveness, go to church, go to youth groups, go to Christian schools. But, **being in a Christian environment doesn't mean that he/she is a Christian.**
	- [[Luke 6#43]] - [[Luke 6#45]]: Know the tree by its fruit.
	- We need to share the gospel to our children by our whole life and help them understand the gospel.
		- [[Ezek 36#25]] - [[Ezek 36#27]]
			- Forgiveness is found in the gospel.
				- Our children needs to know that they are sinful. But God will forgive them of their sins.
			- God changes our hearts, not us.
				- God changes our children's hearts.
				- Our actions can teach our children that if they just behave well God will love them. That's work-based salvation!!! In Galations, these are not God's will!
			- Our actions need to communicate that we are sinful people, and we need Christ! Not our works!!!
	- FOCUS ON THE HEART!!! NOT THE ACTIONS.
		- How we do this?
			- [[Ephes 6#1]] - [[Ephes 6#4]]
				- We has authority over our children, but we are under God's authorities ourselves. -> maintain the kindness and gentleness needed.
					- If they don't understand that God has authority, and we were given authority, they will rebel - against us and God.
					- If they respect the authority that God has given us, they will be blessed. Like Adam and Eve, when they are under God's judgement - they enjoy much blessings. The moment they step out of God's judgement of good and evil, bad things start coming in.
				- [[Ephes 6#4]] don't "provoke [our] children to anger. but raise them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."
			- Teach our children when they are young, then they would not stray from the path ([[Prov 22#6]])
		- Ask the question "What's going on in his/her heart?" when our children do something, good or bad.
			- [[Prov 9#7]] - [[Prov 9#10]]
				- Two people is discribed: a fool and a wise men.
					- The fool dejects reproof.
				- When we teach our children, see if their state is fool or wise - see how they will response.
					- A child's (and ours') heart are never neutral. They will be a heart of a fool, or a heart of a wise man.

### Ending note
- Our lives are short, we are eternal beings. Either we live with Him eternally, or be eternally separated from him. But our actions continue: how we treat our spouse, how we treat our children will affect how our children treat their spouses, how our children treat their children.
	- Ultimately: will our children know God, with our actions be the seeds?
	- Are we living for tomorrow, or eternity?
	- Our actions can be used by God for eternal values.
- If we want [[Josh 24#14]] - [[Josh 24#15]]: We and our families worship the Lord to be true. We need to give our hearts to Jesus, entrust him with our lives and our children.
- After Joshua comes Judges - spanning about 100 years (approximately 4 generations). And the last verse in Judges says: [[Judg 21#25]]. Our actions are like a domino chain - they can lead to good affects, or bad ones - much longer than the duration of the action itself.

### Punishment
- When a child sin, they need to face the consequence. Then - we need to create a safe environment for our children to learn from their mistakes.
- NEVER discipline a child in anger. But maintain a safe environment for the child to stand up and say sorry and keep the relationship with them and us, and them and their siblings.
