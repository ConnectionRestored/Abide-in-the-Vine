## Mechanical Waves
### Terminologies
- The original wave is called the **incident wave** and the reflected one is called, well, **reflected wave.**

### Reflection in Longitudinal Waves

- The wave simply bounces off and comes back when it hit a boundary.
### Reflection in Transverse Waves

- The wave's transverse waves are reflected depends on what type of boundary it hits.
	- A **fixed boundary** is where the ending point cannot move.
	- A **free boundary** is where the ending point can move.
- When the incident wave meets a free boundary, it is reflected just as it came into the boundary.
- When the incident wave meets a fixed boundary, it is reflected as an inverted wave.

## Light
- Reflection happens whenever light changes direction.
- Two types of reflections
	- **Specular reflection:** when an object is flat and shiny, light reflects in mainly one direction, giving an image that is close to the original one.
	- **Diffuse reflection:** when an object is rough, light reflects in many directions, giving an image that is distorted according to the shape of the object - if an image at all.
