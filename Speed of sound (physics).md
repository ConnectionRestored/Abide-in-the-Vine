### #Definition
- The speed of sound depends on temperature:
	- The warmer the air, the faster sound travels.
	- At $20^\circ C$ (about room temperature), the speed of sound is **343 m/s**

### Terms
- *Supersonic* means faster than the speed of sound
	- "*Mach*" is the term used to describe a multiple of the speed of sound.
		- Mach 1 = 1 x the speed of sound
		- Mach 2 = 2 x the speed of sound
- *Subsonic* means slower than the speed of sound
