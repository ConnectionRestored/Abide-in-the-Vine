Devotion for [[Word of Life Academy]]

---
Bible passage:
- [[Mark 8]]
- [[Ps 37]]

### #Definition
- Commitment has many meanings!
- Commitment literraly means "to roll." Picture rolling a snowball and handing it to someone. In this case, this snowball represents our worries, troubles, studies, feelings, and even, and importantly, sins. We are rolling them up, and then giving it to the Lord in trust. Knowing that He will take care of them, for He loves us, cares for us, and can work things out for our ultimate good!

### 1-person story
israel's recent attack on the philistines had stirred up this mighty enemy against them but now the people were in no shape to fight back. king saul had made godless and arrogant decisions leading israel into confusion distress and fear so that their eyes were not on
the victory God could provide but only on an enemy that outnumbered them by the thousands many of king saul's armies had deserted him and the few who remained lay hiding in caves rocks tombs and cisterns but among the faithless there lived one courageous young man who would not submit to defeat his name was jonathan and he was the king's own son.

jonathan knew that if God was for them it didn't matter how many stood against them he pointed to the top of the cliff as he spoke to his armor-bearer:

“Come on, let’s go over to where the Philistines have their outpost.” But Jonathan did not tell his father what he was doing.

No one realized that Jonathan had left the Israelite camp. 4 To reach the Philistine outpost, Jonathan had to go down between two rocky cliffs that were called Bozez and Seneh. 5 The cliff on the north was in front of Micmash, and the one on the south was in front of Geba. 6 “Let’s go across to the outpost of those pagans,” Jonathan said to his armor bearer. “Perhaps the Lord will help us, for nothing can hinder the Lord. He can win a battle whether he has many warriors or only a few!” (I was commiting this attack to the Lord, how can I and my attendant win this battle?)

7 “Do what you think is best,” the armor bearer replied. “I’m with you completely, whatever you decide.”

8 “All right, then,” Jonathan told him. “We will cross over and let them see us. 9 If they say to us, ‘Stay where you are or we’ll attack you,’ then we will stop and not go up to them. 10 But if they say, ‘Come on up and fight,’ then we will go up. That will be the Lord’s sign that he will help us defeat them.” I said this with complete faith, I haven't pray to God about this. I'm commiting this attack to the Lord.

11 When the Philistines saw them coming, they shouted, “Look! The Hebrews are crawling out of their holes!” 12 Then the men from the outpost shouted to Jonathan, “Come on up here, and we’ll teach you a lesson!”

That was the signal! God heard us! “Come on, climb right behind me,” Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “for the Lord will help us defeat them!”

13 [So they climbed up using both hands and feet, and the Philistines fell before me and my armor bearer.]

15 After our attack, , panic broke out in the Philistine army. And just then the Lord sent an earthquake to the Phillistine's camp, and everyone was terrified.

20 When Israel's army arrived at this scene, they found the Philistines attacking each other. There was terrible confusion everywhere. Some of our soldier who betrayed us and joined forces with the Philistines started attack the Phlistines, too! Likewise, the men of Israel who were hiding in the hill country of Ephraim joined the chase when they saw the Philistines running away. 23 So the Lord saved Israel that day, and though the battle still continues, I was glad that He used my trust and commitment to give Israel this victory!
