# Reflective writing ([[MOCS Language Arts 10B]])

## What?
- A reflective essay is a look-at-the-past at key personal experiences, showing how this experience has impacted an author's life.

### The different parts of a reflective essay
- Any reflective essay has two parts: a narrative and a reflection. These two parts are then seperated into 3 sections - introduction, body and conclusion.
	- **Introduction**: Introduce the experience in a way that "hooks" them.
	- **Body:** Vivid representation of the experience while using dialogue, pacing and descriptive detail.
	- **Conclusion:** Directly or indirectly provide reflections on the experience. Make sure readers understand how I am moved or changed by the event.
