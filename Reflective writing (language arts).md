# Reflective writing ([[MOCS Language Arts 10B]])

## What?
- A reflective essay is a look-at-the-past at key personal experiences, showing how this experience has impacted an author's life.

### The different parts of a reflective essay
- Any reflective essay has two parts: a narrative and a reflection. These two parts are then seperated into 3 sections - introduction, body and conclusion.
	- **Introduction**: Introduce the experience in a way that "hooks" them.
	- **Body:** Vivid representation of the experience while using dialogue, pacing and descriptive detail.
	- **Conclusion:** Directly or indirectly provide reflections on the experience. Make sure readers understand how I am moved or changed by the event.

## Revising
#### Why?
- While writing the first draft, it is easy to include unnecessary information, leaving out important ones, or just not organize ideas clearly. When we revise our work, we look at it through the lens of the reader and make changes in order to improve it.
- Revising is not editing! It's not about eliminating grammatically errors, its more about adding precise language and sensory details.

#### Adding precision
- Try using precise language and adding details that would make the reflective essay "comes alive."
- Example: *I threw a ball at him.* -> *I picked up a colorful rubber ball and tossed it gently at the toddler.*

#### Adding sensory details
- Describing what you saw, heard, tasted, smelled, or touched can help "share" that memory of yours to the readers.

#### Adding flow
- To add flow, use transitional words and phrases or continue an idea from a paragraph to the next.

#### General additions
- **Introduction** should hook readers and allude to the important observation or lesson learned from the event.
- Give clues about the impact of an event as suspense is built.
- Express emotions in suitable places.
- The conclusion should state or strongly imply the event's overall impression.

### Proof-reading
- **Give it time.** After you revise, let your writing sit for some time before you return to it. Waiting a day or two will allow you to see it with fresh eyes.
- **Read it aloud.** When you read your essay aloud, you "hear" problems that you may accidentally skip while reading silently in your head.
- **Triple-check it.** Some writers focus on just one proofreading task at a time: They just look for spelling errors, then grammatical errors, then punctuation errors. With this method, you will read your paper multiple times and have more opportunity to see any weaknesses you'd like to remedy.
- **Ask for help.** Revising and proofreading your work on your own is an important skill, but you can also ask a trusted writing peer to check your work after you've proofread it.
- **Run spell-check.** Finally, get a little help from technology. Be sure to use the spell-check feature on your computer to review for any spelling errors you may have overlooked.
