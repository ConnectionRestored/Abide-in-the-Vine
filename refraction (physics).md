# What is Refraction?
- Refraction is the *bending* of light when it hits a boundary between two mediums.
- While working with refractions, angles are measured with respect to the *normal line.*

# Why does Refraction occur?
Light can travel through a vacuum at the speed of [[the speed of light (physics)]] But when it hits something other than vacuum, it has to travel through particles. More specifically, it's energy must be absorbed and then re-emitted from particle to particle, decreasing its velocity. And because of this change in speed, the light also changes direction. This change is called *refraction.*

# Characteristics of Refraction
When light enters a new medium:
- Its velocity and wavelength are reduced by the same factor.
- Its frequency is **not** changed.

# Index of Refraction
## What?
- The Index of Refraction is a number that represents the factor by which the velocity and wavelength of light decreases when it enters a new medium.
## Calculation
$$n = \frac{c}{v_{medium}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{light in vacuum}}}{\lambda_{\text{light in medium}}}$$
With:
- $c$ being [[the speed of light (physics)]].
## Known Indexes of Refraction
- $n_{air} = 1.00029$
- $n_{water} = 1.33$
- $n_{clear plastic} = 1.45$
- $n_{crown glass} = 1.52$
- $n_{diamond} = 2.417$

## Total Internal Reflection

- When light travels from a higher index of refraction to a lower index of refraction, it is possible that all light rays will be reflected back into the original medium when the angle of refraction reaches $90^\circ$. 
	- In this case, the angle of incidence is called the **critical angle ($\theta_c$).**
	- Plugging $\theta_2 = 90^\circ = 1$ into [[Snell's Law (physics)]], we get:
		- $$n_1*sin\theta_c = n_2*sin90 \rightarrow sin\theta_c = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$$
