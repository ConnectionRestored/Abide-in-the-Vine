### #Definition 
- An autobiography focuses on the subject's experience of an event, rather than just the details of the event itself.
- As a result, an autobiographical work is likely to include some verifiable facts and some details that only the author would know to be true.
- Most autobiographies also attempt to explain what meaning key events held for the author.
