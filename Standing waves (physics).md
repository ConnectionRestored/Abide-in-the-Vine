### #Definition 
![[Pasted image 20220919195235.png]]
- A **standing wave** is created when the incidental wave and the reflected wave are directly out of phase - the crest of one meets the trough of the other. The result is a series of constructive and destructive interference.
- A standing wave naturally occurs at the [[fundamental frequency (physics)]].
### Harmonics
- When a standing wave occurs at the fundamental frequency, it creates the [[harmonics (physics) | first harmonic]]. 

### Terminologies
- **Nodes** are places where there is a complete destructive interference.
- **Antinodes** are places where the largest displacement is found.
- One particular length of robe can have multiple standing waves, but they are always at the intervals of half a wavelength.
