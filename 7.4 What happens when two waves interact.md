# What happens when two waves interact?
- The waves interact with one another creating an **interference** pattern.
- A **superposition** is where 2 or more waves are combined in the same spot.
	- The *Superpositions principle* states that when two things happen at the same time, the result will be
#### When two waves interact, two types of interference can occur:

1. Constructive interference
- When two waves momentarily overlap and combine to form a **larger wave**. 
- To create constructive interference, a crest must meet a crest or a trough must meet a trough.
2. Destructive interference
- When two waves momentarily overlap and combine to partially or totally cancel each other.
- To create a destructive interference, a crest must meet a trough.
> **The interference only happens when the waves are at the same point at the same time**
> When the two waves pass each other, they return to what they were prior.

# What happens when waves are reflected?
- The original wave is called the **incident wave** and the reflected one is called, well, **reflected wave.**
#### Longitudinal waves
- The wave simply bounces off and comes back when it hit a boundary.
#### Transverse waves
- The wave transverse waves are reflected depends on what type of boundary it hits.
	- A **fixed boundary** is where the ending point cannot move.
	- A **free boundary** is where the ending point can move.

- When the incident wave meets a free boundary, it is reflected just as it came into the boundary.
- When the incident wave meets a fixed boundary, it is reflected as an inverted wave.

# What are standing waves, how are they created?

- A **standing wave** is created when the incidental wave and the reflected wave are directly out of phase - the crest of one meets the trough of the other. The result is a series of constructive and destructive interference.
- **Nodes** are places where there is a complete destructive interference.
- **Antinodes** are places where the largest displacement is found.
- One particular length of robe can have multiple standing waves, but they are always at the intervals of half a wavelength.
