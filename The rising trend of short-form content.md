Short-form content, which often refers to videos under 10 minutes in length, is growing in popularity in our culture as more and more people create and consume it. I believe TikTok's numbers, a popular short-video platform, show how deeply this phenomenon has ingrained itself in our culture. As of August 2022, TikTok had a total of 2.6 billion downloads and 1 billion "monthly active users." An average "TikToker" spends an average of 1.5 hours on the app. Furthermore, this trend has compelled major platforms such as YouTube and Instagram to release their own versions of the same idea. There are numerous reasons for the popularity of short-form content, but most boil down to one thing: it removes barriers for both creators and audiences. For creators, short videos are generally easier to create than long-form content, and the format enable them to quickly adapt to other cultural trends. For consumers, they don't have to pay anything to access this type of content. Furthermore, the videos' length and the personalized feed that websites and apps of this type provide also removes the time barrier and the need to do some searching before finding the content that consumers find interesting and engaging. This type of media has become entrenched in our society, and I don't think it's going away anytime soon. It is up to us to responsibly use this tool for good.
