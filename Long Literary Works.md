### Difference between a novel and a short story
- Novels have [[parralel plots (language arts)]] and [[subplots (language arts)]], where short stories don't.

### Analyzing Literary Works
- The most important element to consider when analyzing a novel is the effect of plot events on a characterâ€™s growth or development.
- Ask the following questions to figure out a long literary work's theme:
	- What kind of person is the main character?
	- What was the problem?
	- How does the main character react to the problem?
	- How do the people around him react?
	- In what way, if any, does the event change him?
