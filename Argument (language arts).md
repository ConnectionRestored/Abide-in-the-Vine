### Evaluating an argument
- To evaluate an argument, you need to compare new ideas to what you already know, look for mistakes in the logic of an argument, and verify for yourself that the claims are really true.
- Steps on how to evaluate an argument
	- 1. Determine the author's credibility
		- Is this author or speaker generally trustworthy? Has she been honest (and right) in the past?
		- Does the person usually tell the whole truth--or does he often exaggerate or leave out important details?
		- Is the source a known authority or expert on the subject of the claim?
		- Does the source show any sign of bias? Does he have a self-serving reason to make this argument?
	- 2. Verify the logical correctness of the author's reasons.
	- 3. Verify the evidences
