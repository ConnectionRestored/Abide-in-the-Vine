# Exodus Studies
[[Exod-04#v31]]
- Just as He has seen the affliction of his people and delivered them from bondage and slavery, bringing them out of Egypt to a land flowing with milk and honey, where they can prosper, he did the same to all man-kind. God has seen the afflictions that we inflicted on each other, and has become man, become the Savior that we needs. In Jesus, we are delivered, freed to do what is right! Because of God's Spirit in us, we are truly alive.
