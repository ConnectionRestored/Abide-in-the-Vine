# Nimble Notes
[[Exod-04#v31]]
- Just as He has seen the affliction of his people and delivered them from bondage and slavery, bringing them out of Egypt to a land flowing with milk and honey, where they can prosper, he did the same to all man-kind. God has seen the afflictions that we inflicted on each other, and has become man, become the Savior that we needs. In Jesus, we are delivered, freed to do what is right! Because of God's Spirit in us, we are truly alive. 
[[Exod-15#v27]]
- Right after they travel through the wilderness of Shur - where there was no water and the wilderness of Marah - where the water was undrinkable, God led them to Elim - where there were 12 springs of water and 70 palm trees! He provided for their needs in his grace and kindness! 
[[Exod-16#v18]]
- He gave the Israelites just as much as they needed - no more, no less. This fact parallels with what Jesus taught us to pray for: "Give us this day our daily bread." ([[Matt-06#v11]])
[[Exod-18#v11]]
- Jethro's words show that what God has done has accomplished its purposes and shows that He is greater than all other gods.
