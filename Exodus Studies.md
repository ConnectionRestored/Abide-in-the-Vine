# Nimble Notes
[[Exod-04#v31]]
- Just as He has seen the affliction of his people and delivered them from bondage and slavery, bringing them out of Egypt to a land flowing with milk and honey, where they can prosper, he did the same to all man-kind. God has seen the afflictions that we inflicted on each other, and has become man, become the Savior that we needs. In Jesus, we are delivered, freed to do what is right! Because of God's Spirit in us, we are truly alive. 
[[Exod-15#v27]]
- Right after they travel through the wilderness of Shur - where there was no water and the wilderness of Marah - where the water was undrinkable, God led them to Elim - where there were 12 springs of water and 70 palm trees! He provided for their needs in his grace and kindness! 
[[Exod-16#v18]]
- He gave the Israelites just as much as they needed - no more, no less. This fact parallels with what Jesus taught us to pray for: "Give us this day our daily bread." ([[Matt-06#v11]])
[[Exod-18#v11]]
- Jethro's words show that what God has done has accomplished its purposes and shows that He is greater than all other false gods.
[[Exod-18#v3]]
- Moses continually get access to God - until the end of the book when he doesn't - but then he get direct access to God again in the following books. Why is it?
[[Exod-23#v9]], [[Exod-22#v21]]
- Interestingly, God repeats this command about treating foreign residents kindly.
[[Exod-23#v19]]
- Here, the Feast of Harvest and the Feast of Ingathering - both feasts are related to the produces of the field - were decreed. But then, comes a command that seems to be out-of-place: "You must not cook a young goat in its motherâ€™s milk." But it is a practice of fertility cults - they thought doing so would increase their flock - we are not to do so to increase our flocks - only God gives increase. A more general command of this is given in [[Exod-23#v24]]
[[Exod-23#v20]]
- Here, it is hinted that "God prepares the Promised Land for Israel." [[2022-10-17|When I read this]], a doubt popped into my head: "How has God prepared the land?" But then, I get to hear an explaination: He will send hornets and drive the native inhabitants out ([[Exod-23#v28]]).
[[Exod-24#v17]]
- The Israelites can see the glory of God, but still, they gave themselves to idols. It shows how hard their hearts is, but also how hard our hearts is: we see God's glory everyday through his creation, but we never even thought of bowing down to the Creator and worship.
[[Exod-25#v8]]
- Not only do Israel get the One True God to be their God, the Presence of God will dwell in their midst! WOW. Jesus came to us and dwelt in our midst, in whom the fullness of God dwells bodily ([[Col-02#v9]]). To eternally reconcile us to God, he sacrificed his own life for us, and then rose from the grave the third day. Now, through Jesus, we get unlimited access to God and His Presence: in prayer, and also by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit!! We are God's temple!!! What a privillege that it is. Praise God!
