# Romans 9
***



###### 1 
I am telling the truth in Christ (I am not lying!), for my conscience assures me in the Holy Spirit-- 

###### 2 
I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. 

###### 3 
For I could wish that I myself were accursed--cut off from Christ--for the sake of my people, my fellow countrymen, 

###### 4 
who are Israelites. To them belong the adoption as sons, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises. 

###### 5 
To them belong the patriarchs, and from them, by human descent, came the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever! Amen. 

###### 6 
It is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all those who are descended from Israel are truly Israel, 

###### 7 
nor are all the children Abraham's true descendants; rather "**_through Isaac will your descendants be counted_**." 

###### 8 
This means it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God; rather, the children of promise are counted as descendants. 

###### 9 
For this is what the promise declared: "**_About a year from now_** **_I will return and Sarah will have a son_**." 

###### 10 
Not only that, but when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our ancestor Isaac-- 

###### 11 
even before they were born or had done anything good or bad (so that God's purpose in election would stand, not by works but by his calling)-- 

###### 12 
it was said to her, "**_The older will serve the younger_**," 

###### 13 
just as it is written: "**_Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated_**." 

###### 14 
What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not! 

###### 15 
For he says to Moses: "**_I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion_**." 

###### 16 
So then, it does not depend on human desire or exertion, but on God who shows mercy. 

###### 17 
For the scripture says to Pharaoh: "**_For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I may demonstrate my power in you, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth_**." 

###### 18 
So then, God has mercy on whom he chooses to have mercy, and he hardens whom he chooses to harden. 

###### 19 
You will say to me then, "Why does he still find fault? For who has ever resisted his will?" 

###### 20 
But who indeed are you--a mere human being--to talk back to God? **_Does what is molded say to the molder_**, "**_Why have you made me like this?_**" 

###### 21 
Has the potter no right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for special use and another for ordinary use? 

###### 22 
But what if God, willing to demonstrate his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience the objects of wrath prepared for destruction? 

###### 23 
And what if he is willing to make known the wealth of his glory on the objects of mercy that he has prepared beforehand for glory-- 

###### 24 
even us, whom he has called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? 

###### 25 
As he also says in Hosea: "**_I will call those who were not my people_**, '**_My people_**,' **_and I will call her who was unloved,_** '**_My beloved_**.'" 

###### 26 
"**_And in the very place_** **_where it was said to them_**, '**_You are not my people_**,' **_there they will be called_** '**_sons of the living God_**.'" 

###### 27 
And Isaiah cries out on behalf of Israel, "_Though the number of the children_ _of Israel are as the sand of the sea_, _only the remnant will be saved_, 

###### 28 
_for_ _the Lord will execute his sentence on the earth completely and quickly_." 

###### 29 
Just as Isaiah predicted, "If the Lord of Heaven's Armies had not left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have resembled Gomorrah."Israel's Rejection Culpable 

###### 30 
What shall we say then?--that the Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness obtained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith, 

###### 31 
but Israel even though pursuing a law of righteousness did not attain it. 

###### 32 
Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but (as if it were possible) by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone, 

###### 33 
just as it is written, "**_Look, I am laying in Zion a stone that will cause people to stumble_** **_and a rock that will make them fall,_** **_yet the one who believes in him will not be put to shame_.**"
