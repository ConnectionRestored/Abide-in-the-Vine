# Song of Solomon 2
***



###### 1 
I am a meadow flower from Sharon, a lily from the valleys. 

###### 2 
Like a lily among the thorns, so is my darling among the maidens. 

###### 3 
Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.The Banquet Hall for the Lovesick 

###### 4 
He brought me into the banquet hall, and he looked at me lovingly. 

###### 5 
Sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.The Double Refrain: Embracing and Adjuration 

###### 6 
His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me. 

###### 7 
I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the young does of the open fields: Do not awaken or arouse love until it pleases!The Arrival of the Lover 

###### 8 
Listen! My lover is approaching! Look! Here he comes, leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills! 

###### 9 
My lover is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the window, peering through the lattice.The Season of Love and the Song of the Turtledove 

###### 10 
My lover spoke to me, saying: "Arise, my darling; My beautiful one, come away with me! 

###### 11 
Look! The winter has passed, the winter rains are over and gone. 

###### 12 
Blossoms have appeared in the land, the time for pruning and singing has come; the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. 

###### 13 
The fig tree has ripened its figs, the vines have blossomed and give off their fragrance. Arise, come away my darling; my beautiful one, come away with me!"The Dove in the Clefts of En Gedi 

###### 14 
O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places of the mountain crags, let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.The Foxes in the Vineyard 

###### 15 
Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes, that ruin the vineyards-- for our vineyard is in bloom.Poetic Refrain: Mutual Possession 

###### 16 
My lover is mine and I am his; he grazes among the lilies.The Gazelle and the Rugged Mountains 

###### 17 
Until the dawn arrives and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved-- be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountain gorges.
