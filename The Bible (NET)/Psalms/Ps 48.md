# Psalms 48
***



###### 1 
The LORD is great and certainly worthy of praise in the city of our God, his holy hill. 

###### 2 
It is lofty and pleasing to look at, a source of joy to the whole earth. Mount Zion resembles the peaks of Zaphon; it is the city of the great king. 

###### 3 
God is in its fortresses; he reveals himself as its defender. 

###### 4 
For look, the kings assemble; they advance together. 

###### 5 
As soon as they see, they are shocked; they are terrified, they quickly retreat. 

###### 6 
Look at them shake uncontrollably, like a woman writhing in childbirth. 

###### 7 
With an east wind you shatter the large ships. 

###### 8 
We heard about God's mighty deeds; now we have seen them, in the city of the LORD of Heaven's Armies, in the city of our God. God makes it permanently secure. (Selah) 

###### 9 
Within your temple we reflect on your loyal love, O God. 

###### 10 
The praise you receive as far away as the ends of the earth is worthy of your reputation, O God. You execute justice. 

###### 11 
Mount Zion rejoices; the towns of Judah are happy, because of your acts of judgment. 

###### 12 
Walk around Zion. Encircle it. Count its towers. 

###### 13 
Consider its defenses. Walk through its fortresses, so you can tell the next generation about it. 

###### 14 
For God, our God, is our defender forever. He guides us.
