# Psalms 21
***



###### 1 
O LORD, the king rejoices in the strength you give; he takes great delight in the deliverance you provide. 

###### 2 
You grant him his heart's desire; you do not refuse his request. (Selah) 

###### 3 
For you bring him rich blessings; you place a golden crown on his head. 

###### 4 
He asked you to sustain his life, and you have granted him long life and an enduring dynasty. 

###### 5 
Your deliverance brings him great honor; you give him majestic splendor. 

###### 6 
For you grant him lasting blessings; you give him great joy by allowing him into your presence. 

###### 7 
For the king trusts in the LORD, and because of the Most High's faithfulness he is not shaken. 

###### 8 
You prevail over all your enemies; your power is too great for those who hate you. 

###### 9 
You burn them up like a fiery furnace when you appear. The LORD angrily devours them; the fire consumes them. 

###### 10 
You destroy their offspring from the earth, their descendants from among the human race. 

###### 11 
Yes, they intend to do you harm; they dream up a scheme, but they do not succeed. 

###### 12 
For you make them retreat when you aim your arrows at them. 

###### 13 
Rise up, O LORD, in strength! We will sing and praise your power.
