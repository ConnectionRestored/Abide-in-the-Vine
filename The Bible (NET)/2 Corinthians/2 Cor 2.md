# 2 Corinthians 2 (New English Translation) Apostolic Ministry 

###### 14 
But thanks be to God who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and who makes known through us the fragrance that consists of the knowledge of him in every place. 

###### 15 
For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing-- 

###### 16 
to the latter an odor from death to death, but to the former a fragrance from life to life. And who is adequate for these things? 

###### 17 
For we are not like so many others, hucksters who peddle the word of God for profit, but we are speaking in Christ before God as persons of sincerity, as persons sent from God.
