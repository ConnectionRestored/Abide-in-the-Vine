# 1 Peter 2
***



###### 1 
So get rid of all evil and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander. 

###### 2 
And yearn like newborn infants for pure, spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up to salvation, 

###### 3 
if **_you have experienced_** **_the Lord's kindness_**.A Living Stone, a Chosen People 

###### 4 
So as you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but chosen and precious in God's sight, 

###### 5 
you yourselves, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood and to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 

###### 6 
For it says in scripture, "_**Look, I lay in Zion a stone, a chosen and precious cornerstone**,_ **_and_** **_whoever believes_** **_in_** **_him_** **_will_** **_never_** **_be put to shame_**." 

###### 7 
So you who believe see his value, but for those who do not believe, **_the stone that the builders rejected has become the_** _**cornerstone**,_ 

###### 8 
and **_a stumbling-stone_** **_and a rock to trip over_**. They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do. 

###### 9 
But you are _a chosen race_, _a royal priesthood_, _a holy nation_, _a people of his own_, so that you may _proclaim_ _the virtues_ of the one who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. 

###### 10 
You once were **_not_** **_a people_**, but now you are God's people. You were **_shown_** **_no mercy,_** but now you have received mercy. 

###### 11 
Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles to keep away from fleshly desires that do battle against the soul, 

###### 12 
and maintain good conduct among the non-Christians, so that though they now malign you as wrongdoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God when he appears.Submission to Authorities 

###### 13 
Be subject to every human institution for the Lord's sake, whether to a king as supreme 

###### 14 
or to governors as those he commissions to punish wrongdoers and praise those who do good. 

###### 15 
For God wants you to silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing good. 

###### 16 
Live as free people, not using your freedom as a pretext for evil, but as God's slaves. 

###### 17 
Honor all people, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the king. 

###### 18 
Slaves, be subject to your masters with all reverence, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are perverse. 

###### 19 
For this finds God's favor, if because of conscience toward God someone endures hardships in suffering unjustly. 

###### 20 
For what credit is it if you sin and are mistreated and endure it? But if you do good and suffer and so endure, this finds favor with God. 

###### 21 
For to this you were called, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving an example for you to follow in his steps. 

###### 22 
He **_committed_** **_no_** sin **_nor_** **_was deceit found in his mouth_**. 

###### 23 
When he was maligned, he did not answer back; when he suffered, he threatened no retaliation, but committed himself to God who judges justly. 

###### 24 
He **_himself_** **_bore our sins_** in his body on the tree, that we may cease from sinning and live for righteousness. **_By_** his **_wounds_** **_you were healed_**. 

###### 25 
For you were **_going astray like sheep_** but now you have turned back to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.
