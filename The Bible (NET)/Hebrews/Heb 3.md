# Hebrews 3
***



###### 1 
Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, partners in a heavenly calling, take note of Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess, 

###### 2 
who is faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses was also in God's house. 

###### 3 
For he has come to deserve greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house deserves greater honor than the house itself! 

###### 4 
For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. 

###### 5 
Now Moses was **_faithful_** **_in all God's_** **_house_** as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken. 

###### 6 
But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. We are of his house, if in fact we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope we take pride in.Exposition of Psalm 95: Hearing God's Word in Faith 

###### 7 
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "**_Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks!_** 

###### 8 
"**_Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of testing in the wilderness_**. 

###### 9 
"_**There your fathers tested me and tried me**,_ **_and they saw my works for forty years_**. 

###### 10 
"**_Therefore, I became provoked at that generation and said_**, '**_Their hearts are always wandering_** **_and they have not known my ways_**.' 

###### 11 
"**_As I swore in my anger_**, '**_They will never enter my rest!_**'" 

###### 12 
See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has an evil, unbelieving heart that forsakes the living God. 

###### 13 
But exhort one another each day, as long as it is called "Today," that none of you may become hardened by sin's deception. 

###### 14 
For we have become partners with Christ, if in fact we hold our initial confidence firm until the end. 

###### 15 
As it says, "**_Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks!_** **_Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion_**." 

###### 16 
For which ones heard and rebelled? Was it not all who came out of Egypt under Moses' leadership? 

###### 17 
And against whom was God provoked for forty years? Was it not those who sinned, _whose_ _dead bodies fell in the wilderness_? 

###### 18 
And to whom did he swear they would never enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient? 

###### 19 
So we see that they could not enter because of unbelief.
