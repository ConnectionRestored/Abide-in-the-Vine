# Proverbs 9
***



###### 1 
Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out its seven pillars. 

###### 2 
She has prepared her meat, she has mixed her wine; she also has arranged her table. 

###### 3 
She has sent out her female servants; she calls out on the highest places of the city. 

###### 4 
"Whoever is naive, let him turn in here." To those who lack understanding, she has said, 

###### 5 
"Come, eat some of my food, and drink some of the wine I have mixed. 

###### 6 
Abandon your foolish ways so that you may live, and proceed in the way of understanding." 

###### 7 
Whoever corrects a mocker is asking for insult; whoever reproves a wicked person receives abuse. 

###### 8 
Do not reprove a mocker or he will hate you; reprove a wise person and he will love you. 

###### 9 
Give instruction to a wise person, and he will become wiser still; teach a righteous person and he will add to his learning. 

###### 10 
The beginning of wisdom is to fear the LORD, and acknowledging the Holy One is understanding. 

###### 11 
For because of me your days will be many, and years will be added to your life. 

###### 12 
If you are wise, you are wise to your own advantage, but if you have mocked, you alone must bear it. 

###### 13 
The woman called Folly is brash, she is naive and does not know anything. 

###### 14 
And she has sat down at the door of her house, on a seat at the highest point of the city, 

###### 15 
calling out to those who are passing by her in the way, who go straight on their way. 

###### 16 
"Whoever is naive, let him turn in here," To those who lack understanding she has said, 

###### 17 
"Stolen waters are sweet, and food obtained in secret is pleasant!" 

###### 18 
But they do not realize that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of the grave.
