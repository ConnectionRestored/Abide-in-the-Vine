# Proverbs 31
***



###### 1 
The words of King Lemuel, an oracle that his mother taught him: 

###### 2 
O my son, O son of my womb, O son of my vows, 

###### 3 
do not give your strength to women, nor your ways to that which ruins kings. 

###### 4 
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to crave strong drink, 

###### 5 
lest they drink and forget what is decreed, and remove from all the poor their legal rights. 

###### 6 
Give strong drink to the one who is perishing, and wine to those who are bitterly distressed; 

###### 7 
let them drink and forget their poverty, and remember their misery no more. 

###### 8 
Open your mouth on behalf of those unable to speak, for the legal rights of all the dying. 

###### 9 
Open your mouth, judge in righteousness, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.The Wife of Noble Character 

###### 10 
Who can find a wife of noble character? For her value is far more than rubies. 

###### 11 
Her husband's heart has trusted her, and he does not lack the dividends. 

###### 12 
She has rewarded him with good and not harm all the days of her life. 

###### 13 
She sought out wool and flax, then worked happily with her hands. 

###### 14 
She was like the merchant ships; she would bring in her food from afar. 

###### 15 
Then she rose while it was still night, and provided food for her household and a portion to her female servants. 

###### 16 
She considered a field and bought it; from her own income she planted a vineyard. 

###### 17 
She clothed herself in might, and she strengthened her arms. 

###### 18 
She perceived that her merchandise was good. Her lamp would not go out in the night. 

###### 19 
She extended her hands to the spool, and her hands grasped the spindle. 

###### 20 
She opened her hand to the poor, and extended her hands to the needy. 

###### 21 
She would not fear for her household in winter, because all her household were clothed with scarlet, 

###### 22 
because she had made coverings for herself; and because her clothing was fine linen and purple. 

###### 23 
Her husband is well-known in the city gate when he sits with the elders of the land. 

###### 24 
She made linen garments then sold them, and traded belts to the merchants; 

###### 25 
her clothing was strong and splendid; and she laughed at the time to come. 

###### 26 
She has opened her mouth with wisdom, with loving instruction on her tongue. 

###### 27 
Watching over the ways of her household, she would not eat the bread of idleness. 

###### 28 
Her children have risen and called her blessed; her husband also has praised her: 

###### 29 
"Many daughters have done valiantly, but you have surpassed them all!" 

###### 30 
Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting. A woman who fears the LORD--she makes herself praiseworthy. 

###### 31 
Give her credit for what she has accomplished, and let her works praise her in the city gates.
