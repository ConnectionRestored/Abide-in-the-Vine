# Proverbs 27
***



###### 1 
Do not boast about tomorrow; for you do not know what a day may bring forth. 

###### 2 
Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; someone else, and not your own lips. 

###### 3 
A stone is heavy and sand is weighty, but vexation by a fool is more burdensome than the two of them. 

###### 4 
Wrath is cruel and anger is overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy? 

###### 5 
Better is open rebuke than hidden love. 

###### 6 
Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are excessive. 

###### 7 
The one whose appetite is satisfied loathes honey, but to the hungry mouth every bitter thing is sweet. 

###### 8 
Like a bird that wanders from its nest, so is a person who wanders from his home. 

###### 9 
Ointment and incense make the heart rejoice, likewise the sweetness of one's friend from sincere counsel. 

###### 10 
Do not forsake your friend and your father's friend, and do not enter your brother's house in the day of your disaster; a neighbor nearby is better than a brother far away. 

###### 11 
Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, so that I may answer anyone who taunts me. 

###### 12 
A shrewd person saw danger--he hid himself; the naive passed right on by--they had to pay for it. 

###### 13 
Take a man's garment when he has given security for a stranger, and hold him in pledge on behalf of a stranger. 

###### 14 
If someone blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be counted as a curse to him. 

###### 15 
A continual dripping on a rainy day-- a contentious wife makes herself like that. 

###### 16 
Whoever contains her has contained the wind or can grasp oil with his right hand. 

###### 17 
As iron sharpens iron, so a person sharpens his friend. 

###### 18 
The one who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and whoever takes care of his master will be honored. 

###### 19 
As in water the face is reflected as a face, so a person's heart reflects the person. 

###### 20 
As Death and Destruction are never satisfied, so the eyes of a person are never satisfied. 

###### 21 
As the crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold, so a person must put his praise to the test. 

###### 22 
If you should pound the fool in the mortar among the grain with the pestle, his foolishness would not depart from him. 

###### 23 
Pay careful attention to the condition of your flocks, set your mind on your herds, 

###### 24 
for riches do not last forever, nor does a crown last from generation to generation. 

###### 25 
When the hay is removed and new grass appears, and the grass from the hills is gathered in, 

###### 26 
the lambs will be for your clothing, and the goats will be for the price of a field. 

###### 27 
And there will be enough goat's milk for your food, for the food of your household, and for the sustenance of your servant girls.
