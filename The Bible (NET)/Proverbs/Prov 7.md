# Proverbs 7
***



###### 1 
My child, devote yourself to my words and store up my commands inside yourself. 

###### 2 
Keep my commands so that you may live, and obey my instruction as your most prized possession. 

###### 3 
Bind them on your forearm; write them on the tablet of your heart. 

###### 4 
Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call understanding a close relative, 

###### 5 
so that they may keep you from the adulterous woman, from the loose woman who has flattered you with her words. 

###### 6 
For at the window of my house through my window lattice I looked out 

###### 7 
and I saw among the naive-- I discerned among the youths-- a young man who lacked sense. 

###### 8 
He was passing by the street near her corner, making his way along the road to her house 

###### 9 
in the twilight, the evening, in the dark of the night. 

###### 10 
Suddenly a woman came out to meet him! She was dressed like a prostitute and with secret intent. 

###### 11 
(She is loud and rebellious, she does not remain at home-- 

###### 12 
at one time outside, at another in the wide plazas, and by every corner she lies in wait.) 

###### 13 
So she grabbed him and kissed him, and with a bold expression she said to him, 

###### 14 
"I have meat from my peace offerings at home; today I have fulfilled my vows! 

###### 15 
That is why I came out to meet you, to look for you, and I found you! 

###### 16 
I have spread my bed with elegant coverings, with richly colored fabric from Egypt. 

###### 17 
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 

###### 18 
Come, let's drink deeply of lovemaking until morning, let's delight ourselves with love's pleasures. 

###### 19 
For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a journey of some distance. 

###### 20 
He has taken a bag of money with him; he will not return until the end of the month." 

###### 21 
She turned him aside with her persuasions; with her smooth talk she was enticing him along. 

###### 22 
Suddenly he was going after her like an ox that goes to the slaughter, like a stag prancing into a trapper's snare 

###### 23 
till an arrow pierces his liver-- like a bird hurrying into a trap, and he does not know that it will cost him his life. 

###### 24 
So now, sons, listen to me, and pay attention to the words I speak. 

###### 25 
Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways-- do not wander into her pathways; 

###### 26 
for she has brought down many fatally wounded, and all those she has slain are many. 

###### 27 
Her house is the way to the grave, going down to the chambers of death.
