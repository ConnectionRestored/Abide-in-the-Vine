# Proverbs 22
***



###### 1 
A good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth, good favor more than silver or gold. 

###### 2 
The rich and the poor are met together; the LORD is the Creator of them both. 

###### 3 
A shrewd person saw danger and hid himself, but the naive passed on by and paid for it. 

###### 4 
The reward for humility and fearing the LORD is riches and honor and life. 

###### 5 
Thorns and snares are in the path of the perverse, but the one who guards himself keeps far from them. 

###### 6 
Train a child in the way that he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it. 

###### 7 
The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender. 

###### 8 
The one who sows iniquity will reap trouble, and the rod of his fury will end. 

###### 9 
A generous person will be blessed, for he has given some of his food to the poor. 

###### 10 
Drive out the scorner and contention will leave; strife and insults will cease. 

###### 11 
The one who loves a pure heart and whose speech is gracious--the king will be his friend. 

###### 12 
The eyes of the LORD watched over a cause, and subverted the words of the treacherous person. 

###### 13 
The sluggard has said, "There is a lion outside! I will be killed in the middle of the streets!" 

###### 14 
The mouth of an adulteress is like a deep pit; the one against whom the LORD is angry will fall into it. 

###### 15 
Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline will drive it far from him. 

###### 16 
The one who oppresses the poor to increase his own gain and the one who gives to the rich--both end up only in poverty.The Sayings of the Wise 

###### 17 
Incline your ear and listen to the words of the wise, and apply your mind to my instruction. 

###### 18 
For it is pleasing if you keep these sayings within you, and they are ready on your lips. 

###### 19 
So that your confidence may be in the LORD, I hereby make them known to you today--even you. 

###### 20 
Have I not written thirty sayings for you, sayings of counsel and knowledge, 

###### 21 
to show you true and reliable words, so that you may give accurate answers to those who sent you? 

###### 22 
Do not exploit a poor person because he is poor and do not crush the needy in court, 

###### 23 
for the LORD will plead their case and will rob the life of those who are robbing them. 

###### 24 
Do not make friends with an angry person, and do not associate with a wrathful person, 

###### 25 
lest you learn his ways and entangle yourself in a snare. 

###### 26 
Do not be one who strikes hands in pledge or who puts up security for debts. 

###### 27 
If you do not have enough to pay, your bed will be taken right out from under you! 

###### 28 
Do not move an ancient boundary stone that was put in place by your ancestors. 

###### 29 
You have seen a person skilled in his work-- he will take his position before kings; he will not take his position before obscure people.
