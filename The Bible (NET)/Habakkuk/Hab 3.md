# Habakkuk 3
***



###### 1 
This is a prayer of Habakkuk the prophet: 

###### 2 
LORD, I have heard the report of what you did; I am awed, LORD, by what you accomplished. In our time repeat those deeds; in our time reveal them again. But when you cause turmoil, remember to show us mercy! 

###### 3 
God comes from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. _Selah_. His splendor has covered the skies, the earth is full of his glory. 

###### 4 
His brightness will be as lightning; a two-pronged lightning bolt flashing from his hand. This is the outward display of his power. 

###### 5 
Plague will go before him; pestilence will march right behind him. 

###### 6 
He took his battle position and shook the earth; with a mere look he frightened the nations. The ancient mountains disintegrated; the primeval hills were flattened. His are ancient roads. 

###### 7 
I saw the tents of Cushan overwhelmed by trouble; the tent curtains of the land of Midian were shaking. 

###### 8 
Was the LORD mad at the rivers? Were you angry with the rivers? Were you enraged at the sea? Such that you would climb into your horse-drawn chariots, your victorious chariots? 

###### 9 
Your bow is ready for action; you commission your arrows. _Selah_. You cause flash floods on the earth's surface. 

###### 10 
When the mountains see you, they shake. The torrential downpour sweeps through. The great deep shouts out; it lifts its hands high. 

###### 11 
The sun and moon stand still in their courses; the flash of your arrows drives them away, the bright light of your lightning-quick spear. 

###### 12 
You furiously stomp on the earth; you angrily trample down the nations. 

###### 13 
You march out to deliver your people, to deliver your special servant. You strike the leader of the wicked nation, laying him open from the lower body to the neck. _Selah_. 

###### 14 
You pierce the heads of his warriors with a spear. They storm forward to scatter us; they shout with joy as if they were plundering the poor with no opposition. 

###### 15 
But you trample on the sea with your horses, on the surging, raging waters.Habakkuk Declares His Confidence 

###### 16 
I listened and my stomach churned; the sound made my lips quiver. My frame went limp, as if my bones were decaying, and I shook as I tried to walk. I long for the day of distress to come upon the people who attack us. 

###### 17 
When the fig tree does not bud, and there are no grapes on the vines; when the olive trees do not produce and the fields yield no crops; when the sheep disappear from the pen and there are no cattle in the stalls-- 

###### 18 
I will rejoice because of the LORD; I will be happy because of the God who delivers me! 

###### 19 
The Sovereign LORD is my source of strength. He gives me the agility of a deer; he enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain. (This prayer is for the song leader. It is to be accompanied by stringed instruments.)
