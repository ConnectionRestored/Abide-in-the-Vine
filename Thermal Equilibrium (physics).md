# What?
When two substance reach **thermal equilibrium,** they have the same temperature no matter their original temperatures.

# How?
In a space (a room, a box,...), the object with higher internal kinetic energy will transfer some of that energy to the object with lower internal kinetic energy until they are balanced and reach **thermal equilibrium.**
Thermal equilibrium and thermal expansion are two concepts that must be understood prior to continuing your studies of thermodynamics. Let's take some time to review these concepts and talk about the unique properties of water when it comes to thermal expansion.


# Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

- If two thermodynamic systems are in thermal equilibrium with the third, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. 
	- In the example above, because A is in equilibrium with B, and B is in equilibrium with C, A and C are also in equilibrium with each other.
