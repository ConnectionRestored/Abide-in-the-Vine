## How Mirrors Work
![[Pasted image 20221014160506.png|200]]
- Mirrors work because of the [[Reflection (physics)#light|reflection of light]].
## Flat Mirrors
### Why the virtual image seems to be "coming from *behind* the mirror?"
- All the lights that comes from the boy diverged outwards. It's only our perception that makes it seems that the light rays are coming from *behind* the mirror.
	- The image that is formed behind the mirror is a [[virtual image (physics) | virtual image]]

### Characteristics of the image formed by flat mirrors

- Image Size = Object Size
- Image distance from mirror = Object distance from mirror
- Image follows left-right reversal
- Virtual image is formed
## Spherical Mirrors
### Definition
- A spherical mirror is a slice off a sphere. If it would be extended in all direction, it will form a sphere.
- There are two types of spherical mirrors:
	1. Convex Mirror
	2. Concave Mirror
### The parts of a spherical mirror
![[Pasted image 20221014162003.png|400]]
- P: The center of the reflecting surface
- C: "The center of curvature" - the center of the sphere if the mirror were extended in all direction.
- "Radius of curvature:" the radius of the sphere if the mirror were extended in all direction.
- F: the "principal focus" - the midpoint of **C** and **P**. 
- A: the "vertex" - the point where the principal axis meets the mirror.
### Concave Mirror

#### Rules of Concave Mirrors
1. If the incident ray travels parallel to the principal axis, the reflected rays will converge at the principal focus.

2. If the incident ray travels through the focal point, the reflected rays will be parallel to the principal axis.

### Convex Mirror

#### Rules of Convex Mirror

1. If the incident ray travel parallel to the principal axis, it will be reflected "away" from the focal point that is located behind the mirror. In other words, if the reflected ray were to be extended, it will pass through the focal point.
2. If the incident ray travel toward the focal point, it will be reflected back parallel to the principal axis. In other words, if the incident ray travel toward the focal point, itself (the incident ray) passes through the focal point.converge, thus you will always have a virtual image. The size and location of the image can be found where the extensions of the incident rays converge behind the mirror.
