# General
## What is the Great Commission?
[[Matt 28#18]] -> [[Matt 28#20]]

## How does the Great Commission affect our families?
- We focus too much on outward expressions, but then we forget inward expressions (our souls, our families...). This is a very big mistake: **we focus on the work, not the Savior.**

## How do we do this?
### 1. Aligning ourselves with God's values
![[Prov 4#23]] 

- Love what God loves

[[Marriage]]
[[Parenting]]
