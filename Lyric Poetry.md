### Analyzing Lyric Poetry
- Just like [[Narrative Poetry]], [[Poetic Devices | poets use music techniques to increase the power of their words.]]
- Ask the following questions:
	- What sound devices (alliteration, assonance, consonance) does the writer use in the poem?
	- How does the writer create rhythm in the poem? Are there examples of repetition, parallel structure, or internal rhyme?
	- What imagery and figurative language appear in the poem?
	- What emotions do you think the speaker of the poem means to express?
	- How do the musical language, rhythm, and word choice reflect the emotions of the speaker?
