# Main Idea

#### What element should you focus upon while identifying the main idea of a work([[MOCS Language Arts 10B]])
> [!Info] Key note when analyzing novels, memoirs, and narrative poems, or short stories.
> For the work themselves focus on a series of events, consider elements of character, plot, conflict, setting, dialogue, and point of view. The importance of each element will vary from one work to another, so one of your first decisions should be which elements seem most closely related to the story's theme.

- **Poems:** As you read, highlight, and annotate a poem, pay special attention to imagery and figurative language in relation to the poem's theme. Since poems are so short and must pack a great deal of meaning into a few words, symbols tend to be important in poems as well.
- **Plays:** A play is almost all dialogue, so your focus should be to identify the most important lines as well as the outcome of the conflict. Ask yourself how the exchanges between characters reveal the play's big ideas. Also look for any lines that get repeated, either exactly or in a slightly different form.
- **Novels:** In a novel-length work of fiction, consider parallel plots and subplots. What ideas do these components help develop? Sometimes two plots are meant to be compared to each other, with the story's theme represented by the difference.
- **Autobiographical Nonfiction:** In autobiographical writing, the author is speaking to you directly. That means that he or she is telling you only one side of the story. Analyze the author's selective presentation of events: What does this version of the narrative suggest about life?
