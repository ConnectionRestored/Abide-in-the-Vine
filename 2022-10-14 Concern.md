## Passage
- Last week we explored how Jesus was concerned about a huge crowd, and shown his concern by teaching them and giving them food to eat through a very famous miracle! He just keep break up bread and giving it to his disciples - and the bread wouldn't run out! Also there was the fish. Imagine how happy the people would be, not only did they get to listen to Jesus teach, but they get to go home with a full belly.
