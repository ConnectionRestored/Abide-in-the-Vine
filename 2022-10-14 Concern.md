## Passage
- Last week we explored how Jesus was concerned about a huge crowd, and shown his concern by teaching them and giving them food to eat through a very famous miracle! He just keep break up bread and giving it to his disciples - and the bread wouldn't run out! Also there was the fish. Imagine how happy the people would be, not only did they get to listen to Jesus teach, but they get to go home with a full belly.
- [[Phil-04#v10]] - [[Phil-04#v20]]
	- Paul was an apostle, that meant he would be going to different places to tell people about the gospel! 
	- But he was under house arrest because of Jesus in Rome, he really needed help from those who were concerned for him! He need them to provide food. He need them to give him clothes. Everything!
	- And one day, while Paul was locked up in a house, a man from Phillppi came. His name was Epaphroditus, and he brought a bag of money from all the way from Phillippi to help Paul pay for his food. Also, Epaphroditus would stay with Paul, in order to cook for him. Paul wasn't really a good chief.
	- Was that awesome from the people at Phillipi? They were so concerned for Paul that as soon as they heard Paul was under house arrest, they thought: "How can we help him? Well, he need money for food so we will send him some money. And he also need someone to cook for him, so we will send one of our church members to him." That's showing concern!
- BUT SHOWING CONCERN IS HARDD!! Yes, I understand. But when Paul thanked the Christians at Phillippi who were concerned for him, he told them - and we can listen in - 2 wonder truths:
	- Our actions pleases God!
	- He will bless us and meet all our needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus. He will not let you go hungry for a day. And when its winter, He will give you shelter and warmth.
