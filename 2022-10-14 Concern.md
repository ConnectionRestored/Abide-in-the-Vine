## Connect
- Have you ever face a difficult situation? Whether it is some difficult homework... whether it is that stress to behave well in front of others?
- Would you like to receive help when you face a difficult situation?
	-> What you want there is for others to show you concern. In this lesson, we will learn what concern is, how we can show others concern, and some motivation to help us show concern - even when we don't like it!

## Definition
- Concern has almost the same meaning as care. To be concerned about someone is to seek to help him or her when they are in need. To be concerned to somebody is to show that you care for them.
	- Daniel C is sad because people keep calling him Daniel D. Jacob noticed Daniel C's sadness and asked if he was all right. Jacob's was concerned for Daniel C, and sought to help Daniel C.
	- When Hana noticed Moses was tired, she told the teacher. That is concern. Hana was seeking to help Moses by telling the teacher.
	- **Again, it's about action!**

## Passage
- Last week we explored how Jesus was concerned about a huge crowd, and shown his concern by teaching them and giving them food to eat through a very famous miracle! He just keep break up bread and giving it to his disciples - and the bread wouldn't run out! Also there was the fish. Imagine how happy the people would be, not only did they get to listen to Jesus teach, but they get to go home with a full belly.

- [[Phil-04#v10]] - [[Phil-04#v20]]
	- Paul was a missionary, which meant he would travel to various locations to spread the gospel!
	- But because of what he was doing, he were placed under house arrest in Rome, he desperately needed help from those who were concerned about him! He relies on them to provide food. He relies on them to provide clothing. Everything!
	- And one day, while Paul was under house arrest, a man from Phillppi came. Epaphroditus was his name, and he was sent by the churchfrom Phillipi with a bag of money to help Paul pay for his food. Epaphroditus would also stay with Paul to cook for him. Paul wasn't really a good chief.
	- Was that awesome from the people at Phillipi? They were so concerned about Paul that when they learned he was under house arrest, they immediately thought: "How can we help him? We'll send him some money because he needs money for food. He also needs someone to cook for him, so we will send one of our church members to him to stay with him, too." That's showing concern!

## Application
- From this story, we learn of a super-duper simple way to express concern to others. It only takes three easy steps:
	- 1 - Eyes and Ears OPEN! Check to see if your friends or parents need anything. The people of Phillipi kept their ears open, and as soon as they heard Paul was in need, they sought to help help him.
	- 2 - Mind thinking! Consider what you can do to help! Remember how the people at Phillipi think about ways they could help Paul?
	- 3 - Heart Doing! Now comes the exciting part! Doing. Choose the best option you can think of and do it!
## But... it's hard
- BUT SHOWING CONCERN IS HARDD!! Yes, I understand. But when Paul thanked the Christians in Philippi who were concerned about him, he told them two amazing truths:
	- When we show concern for others, our actions pleases God!
	- He will bless us and provide for all of our needs. He will not let you go a day without food. And in the winter, He will provide you with shelter and warmth.
