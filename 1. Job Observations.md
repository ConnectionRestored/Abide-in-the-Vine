# Chapter 1
Job 1:13-Job 1:19
- All he owned (mentioned in Job 1:2-Job 1:3 NLT) were taken away from him. Yet, he bowed in worship.
- "In all of this, Job did not sin by blaming God."
- Prayer: O Lord, help us, so when everything is taken away from us, we might not sin by blamming, even cursing you.

# Chapter 2
- Now, satan urges God to take away Job's health, but still, he didn't sin.
- Prayer: O Lord, help us, when our health is taken away from us, we might not sin by blamming, even cursing, you.

# Chapter 3
- Prayer: O Lord, help us to interpret your words properly, in the way that you meant them to be. For I don't think the sayings of Job's friends should be considered as true, for at the end, you have expressed your anger toward them, and have told them to say sorry to Job.
