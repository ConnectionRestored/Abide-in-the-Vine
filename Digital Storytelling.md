# What?
- *Digital Storytelling* is a multimedia version of a [[Reflective writing (language arts)|reflective essay]] 

# Seven Important Elements
- **1. Point of View:** Who is the storyteller? From what perspective is he or she telling the story? Is the storyteller speaking about a recent event, or one experienced as a young child?
- **2. Dramatic Situation:** Every compelling story involves a question that is asked early in the story and answered toward the end of the story. Will he win the big race? Will he ever reconcile with his father? A dramatic "question" keeps viewers engaged in the story till the end.
- **3. Emotional Content:** Both reflective essays and digital stories focus on serious personal issues, challenges, or successes--even if there is humor involved. How can multimedia help a writer better communicate the emotional content of the story?
- **4. Voice:** How will the voice of the writer be represented in the story? Should he simply read a reflective essay aloud? Should he create a script with several parts, record the different voices, and try to mix or splice together the various audio tracks? Should there be text on the screen, and if so, what parts of the story should it include?
- **5. Soundtrack:** Just like other types of film-making, digital storytelling can involve creating sound effects, music, or other auditory elements that support the story. Sound effects can bring a story to life, while music works well to create or change the mood.
- **6. Level of Detail:** A writer _could_ read the entire version of a story aloud, using video, images, and sound to support its message. However, if the story includes many small, less significant details for reasons other than advancing the plot (such as setting the mood), a writer may choose words and multimedia more selectively. A good approach is to ask which details are essential to tell the story effectively.
- **7. Pacing:** Most stories include elements that can fly by quickly, and others that require more time to sink in. Which parts of a writer's story should she the spend most time on? Which should get the most attention from viewers? Which should get the least? Answering these types of questions can help a writer decide how long to leave one image on screen before switching to the next.
