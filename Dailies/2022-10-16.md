	- Oh Lord, we are not perfect men, saved by your grace only. Our actions, thoughts, and attitudes toward one another is not perfect!! Sometimes, it can cause hurt and mental pain. But I thank you for you used this imperfection to draw us closer to you! You are perfect, and our fellowship with you are perfect. You never let us down or hurt us mentally, never! Our fellowship with one another doesn't sustain us, our fellowship with you do. And our fellowship with one another is only made possible if it was an outward expression of our fellowship with you. So even when someone else accidentally hurt us mentally, WE DON'T HAVE TO BE SAD, we just need to look toward you!!

	- Oh Lord, I thank you for you changed aunt Lai's sister's son's heart! He now behaves well, and more importantly, receptive to what is talked about you. In the past, when I says, "God be with you!" - he responses "Oh, really??" - though I think he did that out of his childishness. But now, when I says "God gave me a gift with computers," he smiles in acceptance. Who can do that except you? Praise God! #Answered_Prayers
