- I thank God for I see in myself (even though sometimes accidentally) that I don't rejoice when others get hurt, even when someone hurts me first. That's how God sees the destruction of the wicked, I am greatful to have the same viewpoint as his.
- I also thank God for even though I didn't study in the whole morning, he helped me to study 10 (even more) / 14 planned sessions! He also helped me to complete a literary analysis essay ([[Analysis of It is Well]]) and some tasks for physics!!
- I thank God for he answered my prayers for humbleness. Today, I learn about [[Sound waves (physics)]] and I remembered about one time we go to this restaurant that was quite noisy because of the songs playing there. Then, a server pulled down some vertical mats in an attempt to reduce the noise. There was thoughts in my mind that says "She is illiterate." But that's wrong, for the vertical mats, even a little, still reduces noise. Praise God for this lesson about [[pride]]!
