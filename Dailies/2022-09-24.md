Today is Saturday! That's mean that next day is Sunday! And yes, we get to go to church on sunday - to worship our God, Creator, Father, Savior, to have fellowship with fellow brothers and sisters in Christ in the Holy Spirit, as well as just having a blessed time! Tomorrow will be extra special though, for in the afternoon we will go out and tell others about the gospel! I pray that God will help us, give us the love, the boldness needed to tell others of the gospel, and glorify him. May we, if that's His will, by His grace bring some souls back to Him!

I have a virus for a few days now, but I feel much better today! Praise God.

I also thank Him for He helped me and my brother Khánh to prepare for our youth small group tonight. We get to learn about Jesus, our Messiah: how the Old testament talks about Him, His identity, His mission. AWESOME!

Here are some pictures of our meeting:

Everyone shining ;D!

I also thank God for being with us during this time, and in all our lives. For helping me and Khanh to instruct our brothers. We can't do it without Him!

I also praise God for He answered our (my) prayers and healed Trí sister (Diệp, who was sick {caughing}) and his brother, who feet needs to have about 10 stitches after an accident). Furthermore, Phương didn't leave the zoom after she made an intercession for Bách - who will be having an important test soon. 

I'm also grateful for Dr. Long, who has been kind and ready to help my family when me and my brother were sick. May God be with Dr. Long, may he knows Him more and more, and glorify Him as a doctor!

Praise be to God for his unfailing love, faithfulness and grace. Amen!

#### A lesson on [[pride]]
Today, while I was memorizing Scripture late at night, I was prompted with a thought (paraphrased): "Oh my prayers (and I) are so powerful!." That was pride to the max. That's disgusitng. I've confessed it, and God has forgiven me. But that's so disgusting. It is God who is the source of strength, it is He who answers our prayers and heals. NOT US! NOT BECAUSE I AM POWERFUL. NOT BECAUSE I AM A SON OF A PASTOR! NO, **IT'S BECAUSE OF HIS GRACE, KINDNESS, LOVE and SOVEREIGNTY** that He answers our prayers according to His purpose! *NEVER, NEVER, NEVER because of our merit or because we deserve it!*

### Gratitude for God's protection in my [[evil thoughts | minds]]
I thank God, for I do notice when I have bad and evil thoughts, He protects me by directing me to another thought, and then pointing out that the thought I had was evil. Praise God! He gave us His Holy Spirit so that we might not sin against Him, we can win this battle, not by might, nor by power, but by His Spirit.
