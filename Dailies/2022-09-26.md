	- I thank God for the breakfast He has given me: black noodles and a banana
	- I also thank Him for revealing to me that He has protected me from disencouraging my mom. Yesterday, my mother was talking about opening a restaurant and earning money (to be used for goods purposes) and I said "That's biblical." In my mind I was thinking of the verse in 2 Thessalonians 3:10 that says 'For even when we were with you, we used to give you this command: “If anyone is not willing to work, neither should he eat.”' But God has protected me from saying it, for my mom is not lazy or is she not willing to work. She still studies, she still cook for us, she is an amazing mom! Praise God for her!
	- I also thank God for protecting me from dishonoring His Word while I think and write the paragraph right before this one!
