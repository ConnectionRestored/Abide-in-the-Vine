- What Pharaoh said in [[Exod-10#v10]] and [[Exod-10#v11]] can be confusing to understanding, but I thank you Lord, for you helped us to understand this part of your Word through the Amplified paraphrase of the Bible.
- All the miracles you did in [[Exodus]] is awesome! Thank you for helping us know in part how great you and your power is!
- I thank you for helping me know exactly when the [[Festival of Unleavened Bread]] will take place through a footnote in the Amplified paraphrase, for it might not be clear to some at first glance ([[Exod-12#v15]], [[Exod-12#v16]]).
