- #Answered_Prayers: Praise God! My brother studies Bible and English in a part-time class at [[Liberty School]], but he is usually not studious and focused during class. Today, while he was unfocused, I pray to my Father about him, and He answered my prayer!!!!!! My brother is now much more studious than before! Praise God!
