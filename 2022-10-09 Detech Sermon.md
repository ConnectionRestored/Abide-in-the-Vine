> [!Bible]  [1Pet 5:1-8 - NKJV](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NKJV/60/5/)
> The elders who are among you I exhort, I who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed:Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but willingly, not for dishonest gain but eagerly;nor as being lords over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock;and when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away.Likewise you younger people, submit yourselves to <i>your</i> elders. Yes, all of <i>you</i> be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility, for  “God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble.”Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time,casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.

- Directed related: Shepherds (pastors, leaders of small groups,...); ones desiring to be shepherds; and even the sheep.

## What is the purpose of pastors?
- We all made mistakes. We all had weak times.
	- God knows that we need shepherds (remember the time when Jesus taught a huge crowd, who where like "sheeps without a shepherd?")
	- [[John 10#1]] - [[John 10#18]]
		- Fullfill the flock's need for instruction
		- Fullfill the flock's need for nourishment
		- Fullfil the flock's need for protection
		- Find the lost sheep

## The heart of a pastor
> [!Bible]  [1Pet 5:1-3 - NKJV](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NKJV/60/5/) (boldface added)
> The elders who are among you I exhort, I who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed:**Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but willingly, not for dishonest gain but eagerly;nor as being lords over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock;** 
- *Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but willingly,*
	- Reason: Serving because of compulsion will destroy the work.
		- "Awh, it's only because I was assigned do I lead this small group" - who then will want to be in that small group?
		- "Awh, I only teach church history because I was assigned to" - who then will want to study church history?
- *not for dishonest gain but eagerly;*
	- There is a temptation: doing things for money or glory for ourselves.
- *nor as being lords over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock;*
	- Shepherds are leaders - but God wants us to lead in a very very different way
		- Jesus, who is Master and Teacher, washes his disciples' feet.
		- Paul, who visisted the church at Corinth and Tessalonica - in whom there are lazy people - didn't receive a salary, but work by himself to be a good example to the church members there.
	- Leading by force can give us results (according to our wills) quickly.

-> Constantly checking our hearts, to see if it is clean or not.

## Ones who desires to be pastors
> [!Bible]  [1Pet 5:5-7 - NKJV](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NKJV/60/5/)
> Likewise you younger people, submit yourselves to <i>your</i> elders. Yes, all of <i>you</i> be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility, for  “God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble.”Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time,casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.
- There is a danger when we desire to be pastors, it is a **good desire** (1 Timothy 3:1), but it could lead to pride.
- Praise God! The desire to be a pastor is good, and it is *observed (by the preacher)* to be one of the major signs God gives to a person who is called to be a preacher.
- What should we do while we are not a pastor?
	- Be "submissive to one another" and "clothed with humility."
		- You don't have to agree with everything your leader (s)says, but you **can't attack** he/she/them.
		- The direct result of humility is submission.
	- But what if we are under pastors whose hearts are not pure anymore?
		- Know that God is the one that resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble. So we need to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God, and when its time, he will exalt us. For now, cast our cares upon Him - why? Because He cares for us.

## Attack on pastors
> [!Bible]  [1Pet 5:8-9 - NKJV](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NKJV/60/5/)
> Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world.

## God is our Reward
> [!Bible]  [1Pet 5:10 - NKJV](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NKJV/60/5/)
> But may the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle <i>you.</i>
- God will give us reward that we are worthy of.
	- A joyous truth: God entrusted his flock that he purchased his blood  to us. WOW!
	- He will give us a crowd of glory. (1 Peter 5:4)
- Be faithful to God and his flock, even when there is seemingly no growth. Be faithful to check our hearts so that it match the required [[2022-10-09 Detech Sermon#The heart of a pastor]].
