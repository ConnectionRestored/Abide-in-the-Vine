### #Definition
- An "interference pattern" is created when two waves interact.

### Superposition
- A **superposition** is where 2 or more waves are combined in the same spot.
	- The *Superpositions principle* states that when two things happen at the same time, the result will be the sum of the responses to those things.

### Types of interference

##### Constructive interference
- Constructive interference happens when two waves momentarily overlap and combine to form a **larger wave**. 
- To create constructive interference, a crest must meet a crest or a trough must meet a trough.
##### Destructive interference
- Destructive interference happens when two waves momentarily overlap and combine to **partially or totally cancel each other**.
- To create a destructive interference, a crest must meet a trough.
> [!warning] Caution
> Interferences only happens when the waves are at the same point at the same time.

> [!question] What happen when two interfering waves pass each other?
> They return to what they were prior.
