### #Definition

- Transverse Waves are a type of [[Mechanical Waves]] which particle motion is perpendicular to the direction of the wave movement. Put differently, the particles move perpendicular to the rest position.
- E.g. water waves, vibrations on a string (instrument), and s-waves of an earthquake.

### Terminologies

- **Amplitude** is the maximum displacement from equilibrium.
- **Crest** is the highest point on a transverse wave.
- **Trough** is the lowest point on a transverse wave.
- **Wavelength** is the distance between one complete wave cycle - trough to trough or crest to crest.
