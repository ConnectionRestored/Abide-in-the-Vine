## Bible Stories
- God is compassionate, He shows compassion all the time!
- A super-story!
		- When Jesus were on earth, he would go to different places on foot to do miracles and teach - all showing that He is really God's Son. One time, there were so many people coming and going that Him and the disciples didn't even have time to eat! So they crossed the Sea of Galilee to somewhere quiet, where they could be alone and rest.
		- But because the people really wanted to listen to Jesus teachings, they actually ran along the shore and get to where Jesus and his disciples were going, even before they arrive there.
		- So, as Jesus stepped out of the boat, He saw a huge crowd.This crowd was about 5,000 man! They only counted the man for some reason, so if we were to count the mother and children, it would be 15,000 - or even 20,000! Basically, a lot a lot, a lot lot.
		- Do you guys remember why Jesus go here?
			- To find MUCH, MUCH NEEDED rest.
			- To teach.
			- To heal people.
			- To provide food for the hungry.
		- When Jesus saw the crowd though, He had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So He forsake the much, much, much, VERY much needed rest to serve the crowd.
		- The crowd listened to Him until it got late in the afternoon - when the sun is almost down. When Jesus teach, the people just loose their sense of time! 
		- Because it was late, his disciples came to him and said him: "This is a remote place, and it’s already getting late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the nearby farms and villages and buy something to eat."
		- But Jesus answered: “You feed them.”
		- The disciples were surprised! How can they feed this crowd? Do they need to find the nearest Pizza Place? Or call Word of Life Academy's kitchen for 20,000 spaghetti dishes? So they asked Jesus: "With what? We’d have to work for months to earn enough money to buy food for all these people!"
		- But Jesus asked “How much bread do you have?” “Go and find out.”
		- They came back and reported, “We have five loaves of bread and two fish.”
		- Then Jesus told the disciples to have the people sit down in groups on the green grass. So they sat down in groups of fifty or a hundred.
		- Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, looked up toward heaven, and blessed them. Then, breaking the loaves into pieces, he kept giving the bread to the disciples so they could distribute it to the people. He also divided the fish for everyone to share. He just kept giving out more and more bread! Wow! 
		- The crowd all ate as much as they wanted, and afterward, the disciples picked up twelve baskets of leftover bread and fish. This huge, huge, super huge crowd were filled.
		- And Jesus did all of this, because of His compassion! You see how super-duper awesome the super-power of God's compassion is?
