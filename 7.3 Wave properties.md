# Wave properties
#### [[What is a wave?]]
- A **wave** is a transfer from one place to another. **Mechanical waves** travel through a *medium*, but **electromagnetic waves** do not.
- A **medium** is a substance or material that a disturbance travels through (e.g. air). In other words, a **medium** is a collection of particles that interact with one another to transfer the energy from one place to another through a series of collisions. Once the disturbance traveled through, the particles return to where they are.

#### Mechanical wave types
##### Transverse wave

- The particle motion is perpendicular to the direction of the wave movement. Put differently, the particles move perpendicular to the rest position.
	- E.g. water waves, vibrations on a string (instrument), and s-waves of an earthquake.
##### Longtitudinal wave

- The particle motion is parallel to the direction of the wave movement. Put differently, the particles move forward and back in the same plane as the rest position.
- E.g. sound waves, p-waves of an earthquake.

#### Terminologies
##### Transverse waves terminologies

- **Amplitude** is the maximum displacement from equilibrium.
- **Crest** is the highest point on a transverse wave.
- **Trough** is the lowest point on a transverse wave.
- **Wavelength** is the distance between one complete wave cycle - trough to trough or crest to crest.
##### Longitudinal waves terminologies

- **Amplitude** is the the measure of density of the compressions i.e. the density of the molecules as the wave passes through them.
	- A wave transfering more energy would have a greater *amplitude*.
	- A lounder sound have more energy, causing greater disturbances and higher amplitude.
	- The higher the pressure at compressions and the lower the pressure at rarefactions, the higher the amplitude.
- **Compressions** are the compressed areas of longitudinal waves, corresponding to **crests** in transverse waves. 
- **Rarefactions** are the expanded sections of longitudinal waves, corresponding to **troughs** in transverse waves.
- **Wavelength** are the distance between compression-to-compression or expansion-to-expansion.

#### The speed of a wave #formula 
$$v = \lambda f$$

- $\lambda$ being the wavelength (m)
