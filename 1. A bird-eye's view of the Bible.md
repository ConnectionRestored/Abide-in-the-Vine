> [!warning] Not found in the Bible
> This system is not the way that the Bible organizes itself, its something human create to order manage the content in this awesome book.

## Roles of each section
- **[[Foundational Books of the Bible|Foundational]]:** These books are compass-setting: they include elements like principles, events, goals, promises,... that carry throughout the Bible.
- **[[Historical Books of the Bible|Historical]]:** They take the foundational things and and show how they are lived out in a specific historical context. This section answers the question: how do individuals handle the foundational things?
- **[[Instructional Books of the Bible|Instructional]]:** The content here does not advance the story, it **amplifies** the story.
	- *[[Poetical Books|The poetical books]]*: Reflection of the people's hearts (how they relate to God, how they think about what's happening to them,...) in beautiful poetry.
	- *[[Prophetical Books|The prophetical books]]:* Prophets encourage the people when they are on track, and correct the people when they are off track.
		- Correccting the people when they are off-track: Prophets were teachers of the time: they examine the culture at the time and use their words to address things that are not standing up to the values given in the foundational section, all with the purpose to reform the culture to live up with the foundational values. Why? Because it is when the foundational values are lived out do we see God's promises come true.
