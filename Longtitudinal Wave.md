### #Definition

- Longtitudinal Waves are a type of [[Mechanical Waves]] where the particle motion is parallel to the direction of the wave movement. Put differently, the particles move forward and back in the same plane as the rest position.
- E.g. sound waves, p-waves of an earthquake.

### Terminologies
![[Pasted image 20220919162554.png]]
- **Amplitude** is the the measure of density of the compressions i.e. the density of the molecules as the wave passes through them.
	- A wave transfering more energy would have a greater *amplitude*.
	- A lounder sound have more energy, causing greater disturbances and higher amplitude.
- **Compressions** are the compressed areas of longitudinal waves, corresponding to **crests** in transverse waves. 
- **Rarefactions** are the expanded sections of longitudinal waves, corresponding to **troughs** in transverse waves.
- **Wavelength** are the distance between compression-to-compression or expansion-to-expansion.
