# God's grace and His righteousness

In the series of 10 plagues, God first gave Pharaoh ten real, concrete signs that He is God, not Pharaoh or other Egyptian idols - and giving him an opportunity to let His people go. But Pharaoh would not listen, and that's why God hardened Pharaoh's heart in the last 5 plagues.

In the seventh plague, God displays His righteousness - by punishing the Egyptians with hail for their enslavement of Israel - but also His grace. He let the Egyptians chance to "escape" this plague by simply inside their houses.
