## Short Answer
### 1. Explain using examples, what is simple harmonic motion and why it is an important area of study in physics.
A swing, a pendulum, a mass-spring are all examples of simple harmonic motions. What they all have in common is that in each, something or someone is going back and forth across a point at the center of the motion. This back-and-forth motion is caused by a force always trying to pull that something or someone back to center-point. In technical terms, **simple harmonic motion (SHM)** is a type of periodic motion (repetitive motions that happen in equal intervals) that moves back and forth across a point (the equillibrium) where a restoring force (a force is always trying to push or pull an item undergoing SHM to the equllibrium point) is relative to the displacement from the equillibrium point.

Simple harmonic motion is an important concept to know for it intuitively introduces a student to the concept of *oscillation,[^1]* which comes in handy when the student moves on to study waves or the movement of air particles.

### 2. Define the difference between constructive and destructive interference.  Use a standing wave as an example.
I'm not the owner of the Desmos calculator (https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qdepo1olam), I only used it to get the images.

![[Pasted image 20221006165958.png|400]]
Here we have a incidental wave (in red) and its reflected wave (in blue).

![[Pasted image 20221006170012.png|400]]
The purple wave is the standing wave generated when the incidental wave interact with the reflected wave.

![[Untitled design (1).png|400]]
When a trough meets a trough or a crest meet a crest, the two waves overlap and form a larger wave. This interference is called **constructive interference.**

![[Untitled design (2).png|400]]
But, when a crest meets a trough or vice versa, the two waves overlap and partially or totally cancel each other out. This interference is called **destructive interference.**

In conclusion, there are 2 differences between constructive and destructive interferences:
1. Constructive interference happens when a trough meets a trough or a crest meets a crest. Destructive interference happens when a trough meets a crest and vice versa.
2. Constructive interference generates a larger wave, whereas destructive interference generates a smaller wave than the waves in the system.

### 3. Explain the doppler effect in terms of frequency, wavelength, and speed.

The **Doppler Effect** is defined as a change is the sound's frequency because of the motion of the sound source, the motion of the observer, or both. 

![[Pasted image 20221006173056.png|200]]

When an ambulance's siren produces noise while the vehicle is still, the produced sound waves goes off at a certain frequency in concentric circles around the siren. These sound waves will then reach the observers at the same frequency that it originally gone off, and a pitch based on that frequency is heard.

![[Pasted image 20221006173517.png|300]]
The Doppler Effect takes place when an ambulance's siren produces noise while the vehicle is moving toward an observer. Because of its motion, each consecutive sound wave is produced increasingly nearer to the observer. This meant that, even though the speed of the sound waves are the same[^2], the sound waves will arrive at a higher frequency and lower wavelength than that when it was originally produced. This change in frequency and wavelength gives the siren a higher pitch. 

![[Pasted image 20221007114403.png|300]]

The reverse takes place when an ambulance's siren produces noise while the vehicle is moving away from observer. Each consecutive sound wave, though the speed doesn't change, is produced increasingly further from the observer because of the ambulance's motion. This in turn makes the sound waves arrive at a lower frequency and higher wavelength that thtat when it was originally produced. This change in frequency and wavelength gives the siren a lower pitch.

### 4. You are sitting on the beach and wondering about the properties of mechanical waves. Describe them in terms of ocean waves.

![[Pasted image 20221007120241.png]]

Ocean waves are a type of mechanical waves, that means that they have all the same properties of one:
1. **Amplitude:** The amplitude of waves are the maximum displacement from where the water would be if the ocean were completely still.
2. **Crest:** The crest is the highest point of the wave. 
3. **Trough:** The trough is the opposite of the crest, it is the lowest point of the wave.
4. **Wavelength:** The wavelength of ocean waves are the distance from one trough to another, or one crest to another.
5. **Speed:** The velocity of the wave as it approaches the shore.

### 5. Your vocal cords are attached at both ends, to your throat.  Explain resonance in terms of your vocal cords.

An object is **resonating** when it vibrates because it is under the influence of another vibration that has the same frequency as its natural frequency[^3].

Our vocal chords are open when we breath, but closed when we try to speak[^4]. When speaking, air pass through the narrow gaps left by the vocal cords with a specific frequency that match the frequency of the vocal, making it open and resonating[^5].

### 6. Describe three ways you can lower the intensity of sound from a speaker, at a rock concert.  Refer to the equations learnt in lesson for two of them.

Sound intensity can be calculated by the following formula:
$$I = \frac{P}{Area}=\frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$$
With:
- $P$ being power (W)
- $r$ being the distance from point source.

We can observe that because $r$ is the denominator, it has a negative correlation with the sound intensity. So, if we want to lower the intensity of sound produced from a speaker, one way we can do is to increase the audience's distance from the speaker or the speaker's audience to the audience.

We can observe that because $P$ is the numerator, it has a positive correlation with the sound intensity. So, if we want to lower the intensity of sound produced from a speaker, one way we can do is to decrease the speaker's power level.

The last way we can lower the intensity of sound from a speaker is to turn the volume down. When set the speaker at a lower volume, the amplitude of sound waves the speaker produces will also be lower, meaning that the wave transfer less energy and thus are less intense.

### 7. Describe longitudinal versus transverse waves and give an example of each.
Longitudinal Waves are mechanical waves in which the particles moves parallel to the wave direction. Sound waves or p-waves of earthquakes are examples of longitudinal waves. Transverse Waves are also mechanical waves, but instead of moving parallel to the wave direction, the particles moves perpendicular to it. Water waves or s-waves of earthquakes are examples of tranverse waves.

## Practice
### 8. A spring of spring constant 4 N/m is stretched 0.5 meters.  How strong is the restoring force?
From the problem, we have:
- $k = 4 \frac{N}{m}$ 
- $\overrightarrow{x} = 0.5m$
- $\overrightarrow{F} = ?N$

Using Hooke's Law, we have:
$\overrightarrow{F} = -k\overrightarrow{x}$ 
$\rightarrow \overrightarrow{F} = -4\frac{N}{m}*0.5m$
$\rightarrow \overrightarrow{F} = −2N$ 

Thus, the restoring force is $-2N$ strong.

### 9. Which variable affects the period of a pendulum undergoing simple harmonic motion?
Because we can calculate the period of a pendulum undergoing simple harmonic motion using the following formula, we can see that the the length of the pendulum of the acceleration of gravity affects a the period of a pendulum undergoing SHM. 
$$T_{\text{pendulum}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$

### 10. A wave of speed 5000 m/s  is traveling with a wavelength of 100 meters.  Calculate the period and frequency.
From the problem, we have:
- $v = 5000 \frac{m}{s}$ 
- $\lambda = 100m$
- $T = ? \frac{\text{second}}{\text{cycle}}$
- $f = ? \frac{\text{cycle}}{\text{second}}$

We can calculate the period of this wave with the formula below:
$T = \frac{\lambda}{v} = \frac{100m}{5000\frac{m}{s}} = 0.02s$

We can also calculate the frequency of this wave with the formula below:
$f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{0.02s} = 50$

Thus, this wave has a period of $0.02s$ and a frequency of 50.

### 11. A spring of constant 10 N/m is oscillating a mass of 1kg.  What is the period of oscillation?
From the problem, we have:
- $k = 10 \frac{N}{m}$ 
- $m = 1kg$
- $T = ?s$

We can calculate the period of oscillation using the formula below:
$T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$
$\rightarrow T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{1kg}{10\frac{N}{m}}}$
$\rightarrow T = 2 \pi \sqrt{0.1s^2}$
$\rightarrow T \approx 2 \pi * 0.316s$
$\rightarrow T \approx 1.985s$

Thus, the period of oscillation is $1.985s$. 

### 12. A pendulum on the earth has a period of 2 seconds.  What is the length of the pendulum?
**Given:**
- $g = 9.807 \frac{m}{s^2}$ 
- $T = 2s$

**Want:**
- $L = ?m$

**Equation:**
$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$

**Algebra:**
$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} \xrightarrow{\text{ to solve for L}} T^2 = (2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}})^2 \rightarrow T^2 = 4\pi^2 * \frac{L}{g}$
$\rightarrow T^2*g = 4\pi^2*L \rightarrow L = \frac{T^2*g}{4\pi^2}$

**Solve:**
$L = \frac{T^2*g}{4\pi^2} = \frac{(2s)^2*9.807 \frac{m}{s^2}}{4\pi^2} = \frac{4s^2*9.807 \frac{m}{s^2}}{4\pi^2} = \frac{39.228m}{4\pi^2} \approx 0.9936m$

Thus, the length of the pendulum is $0.9936m$

### 13. How do wavelengths of sound change when you move towards and away from an object emitting sound.
According to the Doppler Effect, as I move toward an object emitting sound, each consecutive sound waves is produced increasingly nearer to me, meaning that the soundwaves will arrive at lower wavelengths. As I move away from the object emitting sound, the opposite is true: each consecutive sound waves is produced increasingly further from me, which means that the soundwaves will arrive at higher wavelengths.

### 14. Victor is standing next to a 100 W speaker at a distance of 0.5 meters.  What is the intensity of sound reaching his ear?
**Given:**
- $P = 100W$
- $r = 0.5m$

**Want:**
- $I = ?\frac{W}{m^2}$

**Formula:**
$I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$

**Solve:**
$I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2} = \frac{100W}{4\pi *(0.5m)^2} \frac{100W}{\pi m^2} = 31.8\frac{W}{m^2}$

Thus, a sound with an intensity of $31.8\frac{W}{m^2}$ are reaching Victor's ear.

### 15. A 3rd harmonic is being produced in a tube that is open at both ends.  The tube is 3 meters long and the speed of sound is 340 m/s.  What frequency will an observer hear?
**Given:**
- $n = 3$ 
- $v = 340 \frac{m}{s}$
- $L = 3m$

**Want:**
- $f_n = ?Hz$

**Formula:**
$f_n = n*\frac{v}{2L}$

**Solve:**
$f_n = n*\frac{v}{2L}$
$\rightarrow f_3 = 3*\frac{340\frac{m}{s}}{2*3m}$
$\rightarrow f_3 \approx 3*56.6666Hz$
$\rightarrow f_3 \approx 170Hz$

Thus, an observer will hear a frequency of approximately $170Hz$. 

### 16. A fourth harmonic is desired by a conductor of musicians.  What type of instrument could and could not create such a harmonic. You do not need to answer in terms of the instrument name, only whether it is open or closed ended.
Because the conductor wants an even-numbered harmonic, only open ended instruments can be used to create it, for closed ended instruments can only create odd-numbered harmonics.

## Application
### A group of physics students set a tuning fork of 500 Hz just above a big cooking pot.  The tuning fork is struck and continues to ring throughout the experiment.
#### 17. The students pour water into the pot until they hear the resonance of the fundamental mode.  Draw the fundamental mode created.
- The fundamental mode created is the first harmonic.
![[Pasted image 20221011110430.png|400]]
#### 18. If the cooking pot is 0.2 meters tall, how long is the wavelength of the resonance created?
**Given:**
- $n = 1$
- $f_1 = 500Hz$
- $L = 0.2m$

**Want:**
$\lambda_1 = ?$

**Formula:**
$\lambda_n = \frac{4L}{n}$

**Solve:**
$\lambda_n = \frac{4L}{n}$
$\rightarrow \lambda_1 = \frac{4*0.2m}{1}$
$\rightarrow \lambda_1 = 0.8m$

Thus, the wavelength of the resonance created is $0.8m$ long.

#### 19. What is an estimate for the speed of sound in this situation?
At $20^\circ C$ 

#### 20. You may discover that the speed of sound seems a bit off.  Write down some ideas on why that is.
