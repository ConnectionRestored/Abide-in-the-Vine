## Short Answer
### 1. Explain using examples, what is simple harmonic motion and why it is an important area of study in physics.
A swing, a pendulum, and a mass-spring are all examples of simple harmonic motions. They all have one thing in common: something or someone is moving back and forth across a point in the center of the motion. Furthermore, this back-and-forth motion is caused by a force that is constantly trying to pull that something or someone back to the center. In technical terms, **simple harmonic motion (SHM)** is a type of periodic motion (repetitive motions that occur at equal intervals) that moves back and forth across a point (the equillibrium) where a restoring force (a force that is always trying to push or pull an item undergoing SHM to the equillibrium point) is relative to the displacement from the equillibrium point.

Simple harmonic motion is an important concept to understand because it intuitively introduces a student to the concept of *oscillation,[^1]* which is useful when studying waves or the movement of air particles.

### 2. Define the difference between constructive and destructive interference.  Use a standing wave as an example.
I did not make the [Desmos calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qdepo1olam), I only used it to obtain the images.
![[Pasted image 20221006165958.png|400]]
Here we have a incidental wave (in red) and its reflected wave (in blue).
![[Pasted image 20221006170012.png|400]]
The purple wave is the standing wave formed when the incidental and reflected waves interact.
![[Untitled design (1).png|400]]
When a trough meets another trough, or a crest meets another crest, the two waves overlap and combine to form a larger wave. This is known as **constructive interference.**
![[Untitled design (2).png|400]]
When a crest meets a trough or vice versa, the two waves overlap and partially or completely cancel each other out. This type of interference is known as **destructive interference.**

In conclusion, there are two distinctions between constructive and destructive interferences:
1. Constructive interference occurs when a trough meets another trough or a crest meets another crest. Destructive interference occurs when a trough meets with a crest and vice versa.
2. Constructive interference produces a larger wave, whereas destructive interference produces a smaller wave than both the incidental and reflected waves.

### 3. Explain the doppler effect in terms of frequency, wavelength, and speed.
The **Doppler Effect** is defined as a change is the sound's frequency because of the motion of the sound source, the motion of the observer, or both. 

![[Pasted image 20221006173056.png|200]]
[^ all the images are taken from the lesson's page]
When an ambulance's siren makes noise while the vehicle is stationary, the sound waves produced go off at a specific frequency in concentric circles around the siren. These sound waves will then reach the observers at the original frequency, and a pitch based on that frequency will be heard.

![[Pasted image 20221006173517.png|300]]
When an ambulance's siren makes noise while the vehicle is moving toward an observer, the Doppler Effect occurs. Because of its motion, each successive sound wave is produced closer to the observer. This meant that, even though the speed of the sound waves remained constant[^2], the sound waves arrived at a higher frequency and shorter wavelength than when they were first produced. This change in frequency and wavelength gives the siren a higher pitch.

![[Pasted image 20221007114403.png|300]]

When an ambulance's siren makes noise while the vehicle is moving away from the observer, the opposite occurs. Despite the fact that the speed remains constant, each successive sound wave is produced further away from the observer due to the ambulance's motion. As a result, the sound waves arrive at a lower frequency and a longer wavelength than when they were first produced. Because of the change in frequency and wavelength, the siren has a lower pitch.

### 4. You are sitting on the beach and wondering about the properties of mechanical waves. Describe them in terms of ocean waves.

![[Pasted image 20221007120241.png]]

Ocean waves are mechanical waves, which means they have all of the same properties as one:
1. **Amplitude:** The maximum displacement of water from where it would be if the ocean were completely still.
2. **Crest:** The crest of a wave is its highest point.
3. **Trough:** The trough is the lowest point of the wave. (the opposite concept of "crest")
4. **Wavelength:** The wavelength of an ocean wave is the distance between a trough and a crest.
5. **Speed:** The wave's velocity as it approaches the shore.

### 5. Your vocal cords are attached at both ends, to your throat.  Explain resonance in terms of your vocal cords.

Our vocal cords are open when we breathe, but they close when we try to speak [^3]. When we speak, air passes through the narrow gaps left by the vocal cords at a specific frequency that corresponds to the vocal cord's frequency, causing it to resonate[^4]. We can derive a more general definition of resonance from this example: an object is **resonating** when it vibrates due to the influence of another vibration with the same frequency as its natural frequency [^5].

### 6. Describe three ways you can lower the intensity of sound from a speaker, at a rock concert.  Refer to the equations learnt in lesson for two of them.

The following formula can be used to calculate sound intensity:
$$I = \frac{P}{Area}=\frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$$
With:
- $P$ being power (W)
- $r$ being the distance from point source.

Because $r$ is in the denominator, there is a negative correlation with sound intensity. So, one way to reduce the intensity of sound produced by a speaker is to increase the audience's distance from the speaker or the speaker's distance from the audience.

Because $P$ is the numerator, there is a positive correlation with sound intensity. So, if we want to reduce the intensity of sound produced by a speaker, one option is to reduce the speaker's power level.

Turning down the volume is the final way to reduce the intensity of sound from a speaker. When the volume of the speaker is reduced, the amplitude of the sound waves produced decreases, meaning that the waves transfer less energy and are thus less intense.

### 7. Describe longitudinal versus transverse waves and give an example of each.
Longitudinal waves are mechanical waves in which the particles move in the same direction as the wave. Longitudinal waves include sound waves and earthquake p-waves. Transverse waves are mechanical waves, but the particles move perpendicular to the wave direction rather than parallel to it. Water waves and earthquake s-waves are examples of tranverse waves.

## Practice
### 8. A spring of spring constant 4 N/m is stretched 0.5 meters.  How strong is the restoring force?
**Given:**
- $k = 4 \frac{N}{m}$ 
- $\overrightarrow{x} = 0.5m$

**Want:**
- $\overrightarrow{F} = ?N$

**Formula:**
- $\overrightarrow{F} = -k\overrightarrow{x}$  (Hooke's Law)

**Solve:**
$\overrightarrow{F} = -k\overrightarrow{x}$ 
$\rightarrow \overrightarrow{F} = -4\frac{N}{m}*0.5m$
$\rightarrow \overrightarrow{F} = −2N$ 

Thus, the restoring force is $-2N$ strong.

### 9. Which variable affects the period of a pendulum undergoing simple harmonic motion?
$$T_{\text{pendulum}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$
The formula above shows that the length of the pendulum and the acceleration of gravity both affect the period of a pendulum undergoing SHM.

### 10. A wave of speed 5000 m/s  is traveling with a wavelength of 100 meters.  Calculate the period and frequency.
**Given:**
- $v = 5000 \frac{m}{s}$ 
- $\lambda = 100m$

**Want:**
- $T = ? \frac{\text{second}}{\text{cycle}}$
- $f = ? \frac{\text{cycle}}{\text{second}}$

**Formula:**
- $T = \frac{\lambda}{v}$
- $f = \frac{1}{T}$

**Solve:**
- $T = \frac{\lambda}{v} = \frac{100m}{5000\frac{m}{s}} = 0.02s$
- $f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{0.02s} = 50$

Thus, this wave has a period of $0.02s$ and a frequency of $50$.

### 11. A spring of constant 10 N/m is oscillating a mass of 1kg.  What is the period of oscillation?
**Given:**
- $k = 10 \frac{N}{m}$ 
- $m = 1kg$

**Want:**
- $T = ?s$

**Formula:**
- $T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$

**Solve:**
$T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$
$\rightarrow T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{1kg}{10\frac{N}{m}}}$
$\rightarrow T = 2 \pi \sqrt{0.1s^2}$
$\rightarrow T \approx 2 \pi * 0.31622s$
$\rightarrow T \approx 1.986s$

Thus, the period of oscillation is $1.986s$. 

### 12. A pendulum on the earth has a period of 2 seconds.  What is the length of the pendulum?
**Given:**
- $T = 2s$
- $g = 9.807\frac{m}{s^2}$

**Want:**
- $L = ?m$

**Equation:**
- $T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$

**Algebra:**
$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} \xrightarrow{\text{ to solve for L}} T^2 = (2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}})^2 \rightarrow T^2 = 4\pi^2 * \frac{L}{g}$
$\rightarrow T^2*g = 4\pi^2*L \rightarrow L = \frac{T^2*g}{4\pi^2}$

**Solve:**
$L = \frac{T^2*g}{4\pi^2} = \frac{(2s)^2*9.807\frac{m}{s^2}}{4\pi^2} = \frac{4s^2*9.807\frac{m}{s^2}}{4\pi^2} = \frac{39.228m}{4\pi^2} \approx 0.9936m$

Thus, the length of the pendulum is $0.9936m$

### 13. How do wavelengths of sound change when you move towards and away from an object emitting sound.
According to the Doppler Effect, as I move toward a sound-emitting object, each successive sound wave is produced closer to me, meaning that the soundwaves arrive at lower wavelengths. As I move away from the sound-emitting object, the opposite occurs: each successive sound wave is produced further away from me, meaning that the soundwaves will arrive at higher wavelengths.

### 14. Victor is standing next to a 100 W speaker at a distance of 0.5 meters.  What is the intensity of sound reaching his ear?
**Given:**
- $P = 100W$
- $r = 0.5m$

**Want:**
- $I = ?\frac{W}{m^2}$

**Formula:**
- $I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$

**Solve:**
$I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2} = \frac{100W}{4\pi *(0.5m)^2} \frac{100W}{\pi m^2} \approx 31.8\frac{W}{m^2}$

Thus, a sound with an intensity of (approximately) $31.8\frac{W}{m^2}$ are reaching Victor's ear.

### 15. A 3rd harmonic is being produced in a tube that is open at both ends.  The tube is 3 meters long and the speed of sound is 340 m/s.  What frequency will an observer hear?
**Given:**
- $n = 3$ 
- $v = 340 \frac{m}{s}$
- $L = 3m$

**Want:**
- $f_n = ?\text{Hz}$

**Formula:**
- $f_n = n*\frac{v}{2L}$

**Solve:**
$f_n = n*\frac{v}{2L}$
$\rightarrow f_3 = 3*\frac{340\frac{m}{s}}{2*3m}$
$\rightarrow f_3 \approx 3*56.6666\text{Hz}$
$\rightarrow f_3 = 170\text{Hz}$

Thus, an observer will hear a frequency of approximately $170\text{Hz}$. 

### 16. A fourth harmonic is desired by a conductor of musicians.  What type of instrument could and could not create such a harmonic. You do not need to answer in terms of the instrument name, only whether it is open or closed ended.
Because the conductor desires an even-numbered harmonic, only open ended instruments can produce it; closed ended instruments can only produce odd-numbered harmonics.

## Application
### A group of physics students set a tuning fork of 500 Hz just above a big cooking pot.  The tuning fork is struck and continues to ring throughout the experiment.
#### 17. The students pour water into the pot until they hear the resonance of the fundamental mode.  Draw the fundamental mode created.
- The fundamental mode created is the first harmonic.
![[Pasted image 20221011110430.png|400]]
#### 18. If the cooking pot is 0.2 meters tall, how long is the wavelength of the resonance created?
**Given:**
- $n = 1$
- $f_1 = 500Hz$
- $L = 0.2m$

**Want:**
- $\lambda_1 = ?$

**Formula:**
- $\lambda_n = \frac{4L}{n}$ (because the cooking pot served as a closed tube)

**Solve:**
$\lambda_n = \frac{4L}{n}$
$\rightarrow \lambda_1 = \frac{4*0.2m}{1}$
$\rightarrow \lambda_1 = 0.8m$

Thus, the wavelength of the resonance created is $0.8m$ long.

#### 19. What is an estimate for the speed of sound in this situation?
The speed of sound can be estimated to be around $343\frac{m}{s}$, for it is the speed of sound at $20^\circ C$ or about room temperature.

#### 20. You may discover that the speed of sound seems a bit off.  Write down some ideas on why that is.

Using the given numbers, the speed of the resonance's soundwaves should be $v = \lambda*f = 0.8m * 500Hz = 400 \frac{m}{s}$. The difference could be caused by the fact that both the cooking pot and the water inside it are considered one object, so when the vibrations of the water collide with the vibrations of the cooking pot, unexpected interactions can occur, slowing the sound. Another reason could be that the temperature in the room where this experiment is being conducted is higher than $20^\circ C$.
