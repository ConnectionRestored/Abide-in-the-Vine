# Persuasion by Hollywood Discussion
Plot summary: Mr. Myers and his family - a colored American - has moved in to Levittown, an once all-white community. This separated the community into 2 groups: the ones that are against the Myers and the ones for them. This documentary film explores both viewpoint, and provide reasons why the racist thoughts against the Myers are false.

Persuasion: Many communities will be separated into 2 groups - one supporting and one against the arrival of colored people and that the viewers should stand-up against racism in their communities.

Main strategy: The commentary -- which disproves racist notions that some members of Levittown has -- is the main strategy the director uses to persuade his/her audiences.
