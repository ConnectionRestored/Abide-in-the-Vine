When reading this stern warning from God, one might cringe because of its "sillyness." It sounds like what a puff from a 8-year-old would sound like. I felt that when I read this passage, but by God's grace, I was prompted to pray against it: Lord, help is to have reverence for you when we read your warnings. I pray this after God has sent a gnat into my room - though I didn't know what this meant.

This morning, when I had my usual morning devotional time and God taught me to fear him through two different "lessons." One was a thought: imagine sitting down on a sunny bench and open up your lunchbox, just to see a frog jumping at your face. How would that feel? Now imagine your hamburger being stamped upon by hoards of frogs, how would you feel? Terrified! The second was an experience: that gnat kept landing on me, but I used my finger to shoosh it away. But one time, the gnat dash right into my left cheeck! I was surprised and scared. Awh!!! Now, that was one gnat. Imagine millions of them! ([[Exod-08#v17]]). That's very scary!

After God said His warning, only to receive an unyielding heart, it was said that: **"And the Lord did so."** and that **Throughout Egypt the land was ruined by swarms of flies.** God is not puffing with His warnings, if we don't repent, He would do what He have said.
