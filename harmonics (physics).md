### Different types of harmonics

> [!tip] Determining the number of harmonic
> To determine the number of harmonic in a string, just count the number of anti-nodes there are. The number of anti-nodes will be the number of harmonic!

- The fundamental frequency (1st wave): $\lambda = 2L$
- 2nd harmonic (2nd wave): $\lambda = L$
- 3rd harmonic (3rd wave): $\lambda = \frac{2}{3} L$


> [!warning] What is a closed tube?
> A closed tube is a pipe that is closed at one or both ends.

#### Harmonics in an open tube

When standing waves are produced in a open tube, the relationship between length and frequency remains the same as it is when harmonics are produced in strings.

- The fundamental frequency (1st wave): $\lambda = 2L$
- 2nd harmonic (2nd wave): $\lambda = L$
- 3rd harmonic (3rd wave): $\lambda = \frac{2}{3} L$

#### Harmonics in an closed tube

**Note:** only odd harmonics are produced by tubes with closed ends

- The fundamental frequency (1st wave): $\lambda = 4L$ 
- 2nd harmonic (2nd wave): $\lambda = 4/3 L$ 
- 3rd harmonic (3rd wave): $f_3 = 4/5 L$

### Calculating Harmonics
##### #formula: Harmonics on a fixed string or open tube

**Calculating the [[frequencies (as in physics)|frequency]] of the harmonic**

$$f_n = n*f_1 = n*\frac{v}{2L}$$
**Calculating the wavelength of the harmonic**
$$\lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_1}{n} = \frac{2L}{n}$$

- $n$ is the harmonic number
- $v$ is the speed of the wave
- $L$ is the lenght of the vibrating string

##### #formula: Harmonics on a closed tube
$$f_n = n*f_1 = n * \frac{v}{4L}$$
OR:
$$\lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_1}{n} = \frac{4L}{n}$$ **Notice:** This formula only works with odd-numbered harmonics, for only odd-numbered harmonics can be created in a closed tube.
