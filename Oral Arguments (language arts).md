### #Definition
### What makes an oral argument different from a written one?

> [!WARNING] What makes audiences to oral arguments more susceptible to it?
> While even the most talented writer must show at least some evidence to be credible, speakers can rely on other tools to convince their listeners of the truth of their arguments.

| Written Arguments                                                                                                                                                      | Oral Arguments                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Written arguments are usually read silently by the reader.  The writer's tone of voice and personal style of presentation do not play a role in persuading the reader. | Oral arguments can build credibility based on the speaker's tone of voice, body language, and rhetorical style.                                                                              |
| Written arguments can be read over and over again, which makes them easy to analyze for evidence.                                                                      | Oral arguments are ephemeral--here one minute and gone the next.                                                                                                                             |
| Written arguments are not accompanied by any form of multimedia except, perhaps, still images                                                                          | Oral arguments can be strengthened through use of emotionally compelling video and music.                                                                                                    |
| Written arguments are usually read by one person at a time, who may discuss the argument later with other people, but only after reading it himself or herself.        | Oral arguments tend to be heard by a group of people at once, and the responses of some in the group can affect other listeners' opinions about the argument even before the speech is done. |

### Evaluating oral arguments
1. Who is the speaker and what is his purpose for making this argument?
2. Spotting [[Logical Fallacies|fallacious reasoning]]. (Checking if the evidences and claim holds together)
3. Recheck evidences with [[Oral Arguments (language arts)#Realiable evidences characteristics]]


### Realiable evidences characteristics
| Characteristic                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The evidence comes from a source outside the speaker. | If a speaker says, "I say,"  "I believe," "the potential exists," etc., he or she is giving an opinion, not evidence.                                                                           |
| The evidence comes from a reliable source.            | Ask yourself whether the source cited is usually accurate and unbiased. Bear in mind that even "authoritative" sources have their own agendas.                                                  |
| The evidence can be examined.                         | If the evidence cited is not available for further examination, the reason may be that the evidence is not real.                                                                                |
| The evidence is unbiased.                             | Ask yourself, Does this source have a special interest in the outcome of this speech? If the answer is yes, then the selection of evidence may be biased.                                       |
| The evidence is sufficient.                           | One piece of evidence may not be enough to support an argument for significant change.                                                                                                          |
| The evidence clearly supports the argument.           | Carefully analyze the relationship between the evidence and the claim to be sure that they hang together logically.                                                                             |
| The evidence is not exaggerated.                      | Using words and phrases that suggest large numbers without providing specific numbers, such as "most," "all," or "the vast majority," helps speakers exaggerate evidence and mislead listeners. |
