### #Definition
- When an instrument produces a specific note, it is not only producing the frequency needed, but also a mixture of different harmonics of the same note. The difference in this mixture makes different instruments sounds differently.
	- Different **timbres** are created as a result of different mixtures of harmonics.
	- **Timbre** or sound quality is the technical term for this concept.

- The tuning fork gives the most pure frequency.
- When other instruments or even human voice tries to produce the same frequency, there will be multiple harmonics created, creating different timbres.
