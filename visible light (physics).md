## #Definition 
![[Pasted image 20221013143845.png]]
- *Visible light* or the *visible spectrum* is a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can see.

# Colors of Light
## Primary Colors of Light
- **Red, Green and Blue** are three primary colors of light.
- Primary colors can be used to create **any** other color in the visible spectrum.
- When primary colors are combined, they produce **white light.**

## Secondary Colors of Light
![[Pasted image 20221013144558.png|500]]
- Secondary colors of light are created by combining two primary colors of light.

## Complementary Colors
- **Complementary colors** are any two colors that combine to form white light.
	- White light are only formed when one primary color are combined with one secondary color
		- Red + Cyan
		- Blue + Yellow
		- Green + Magenta

## Primary Colors of Pigment
- Primary colors of pigment are secondary colors of light: megenta, yellow, and cyan.
- Each primary colors of pigment absorb one of the primary colors of light.
- When all three primary colors of pigment are combined, all colors of light is absorbed -> black.
- Formulas
	- Yellow = R + G (in other words, it absorbs B)
	- Magenta = R + B (in other words, it absorbs G)
	- Cyan = B + G (in other words, it absorbs R)
- A pure pigment absorbs only one wavelength of light.

## Secondary Colors of Pigment
- When two primary colors of pigment are mixed together, they together absorb two primary color of light, leaving one behind.
- Secondary colors of pigment are primary colors of light.

## Math with Colors
- "When we mix Red and Blue, we get Magenta" can be denoted as: R + B = M.
- Because each primary colors of pigment absorbs one primary colors of light, we can denote the mixing together of colors of pigment and colors of light as subtraction.
	- Because any primary colors of pigment absorbs one primary color of light, any colors of pigment can be denoted as White subtracted by the color that it absorbs: Y = W - B

### Primary Colors of Pigment Math Table
| Primary Pigment Color |   Color Subtraction   |            Result           |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------------------:|
|         Yellow        |  W - B (absorbs blue) | (R + G + B) - B = R + G = Y |
|        Magenta        | W - G (absorbs green) | (R + G + B) - G = R + B = M |
|          Cyan         |  W - R (absorbs red)  | (R + G + B) - R = G + B = C |

### Secondary Colors of Pigment Math Table
| Secondary Pigment Color | Addition of Pigments | Absorbs |
|:-----------------------:|:--------------------:|:-------:|
|           Red           |        Y + M         |  B + G  |
|          Blue           |        M + C         |  G + R  |
|          Green          |        C + Y         |  R + B  |


> [!warning] The "light" is not always white light.
> Other lights like cyan or yellow can be shone on an object, too! Make sure to take this into account while doing maths with colors!

## Filters
- Filters are transparent objects that only allow certain wavelengths to pass through them while absorbing the other. More specifically, a filter absorbs its complementary color.
	- Yellow's complementary color is Blue, that means when white light passes through a yellow filter, the filter will absorbs blue, letting only red and green light pass through. And red light when combined with green light give yellow!
