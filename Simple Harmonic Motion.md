### #Definition 
- **Simple harmonic motion (SHM)** is any type of [[Periodic motion | periodic motion]] that moves back and forth across an equilibrium point in which a restoring force is proportional to the displacement from that equilibrium point. (SHM is the periodic motion that results from a restoring force.)
	- The result of SHM: oscillation (back-and-forth motion)
	- The force in a SHM is constantly changing as it is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium point, which is constantly changing.
	- [[The Restorative Force]] acts to pull an object in a SHM back to the equilibrium.

### What a motion needs to be a SHM
- At the equilibrium position, the speed reaches its maximum.
- At maximum displacement (amplitude), the restoring force is greatest, and acceleration reaches maximum.
- In SHM, the restoring force is proportional to displacement.

### SHM in a [[Mass-spring system]]

- The block is attached to a horizontal spring and is at rest on a table with 0 friction.
- If we pull the block to the right 1 inch, it would [[oscillate]] - moves back and forth through an [[equilibrium point]] - the point where the force was 0.
- The spring is providing the restoring force, for on every other point along the path of the back and forth motion, the spring would be pushing or pulling the block back toward the equillibrium point.

#### The relationship between [[acceleration]], [[force]] and [[displacement]] in a SHM
- The acceleration of the object is directly proportional to the displacement of the object from its equilibrium position.
- The velocity of the object is inversely proportional to the displacementâ€”the further away from the equilibrium point, the smaller the velocity will be.
