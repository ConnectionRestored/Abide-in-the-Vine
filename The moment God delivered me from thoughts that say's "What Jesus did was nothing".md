# The moment God delivered me from thoughts that say's "What Jesus did was nothing"
Christ shed His blood, He suffered hell on the cross. Yes He rose again, but He still suffered. Doesn't change the point that He suffered. [His blood is precious, both to God and to us](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/erik-raymond/the-precious-blood-of-christ/), and He shed it.

I had thoughts that says "Oh no, Jesus did nothing on the cross. He rose again, now rejoicing at the right-hand of the Father." No. Doesn't change the point that He suffered.

But that thought continued to taunt and haunt me, but God delivered me and gave me [[Ps-18|Psalms 18]] to pray through. As I pray through this prayer of deliverence, God delivered me from this thought and doubt. Now, though I haven't understand how precious the blood of Jesus really are, I don't have that thought anymore. Praise God!
