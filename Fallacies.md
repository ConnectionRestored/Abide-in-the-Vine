### Different types of Fallacies
| Name                      | Description                                                                                                                      | Example                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Appeal to Authority       | an argument that includes a reference to a well-known person or celebrity for support, even though he/she is rarely an authority | Example: This sunscreen must be the most effective against skin cancer because actress Jennifer Lopez endorses it.                                               |
| Circular Argument         | an argument in which the proposition or claim is supported by the reasons--which are then supported by the claim                 | Example: We know that Senator Fielding has misused campaign funds because more than one watchdog group has accused him of it. Where there's smoke, there's fire! |
| Non Sequitur              | an argument that uses "reasons" that have nothing at all to do with the claim                                                    | Example: America is a country of hard workers. Therefore, Congress must pass this new jobs bill.                                                                 |
| Association Fallacy       | based on a fact that does not support the claim, but is only associated with some aspect of the topic                            | Example: Countless politicians have been caught lying. Therefore, we can assume that Mayor Wells has lied to us about toxic waste dumps in our city.             |
| Appeal to Popular Opinion | relies on the fact that most people want to be liked or to fit in with the majority of their peers                               | Example: Seventy-eight percent of shoppers can't be wrong: Sunny Day orange juice is the freshest and best tasting.                                              |
| Slippery Slope            | uses the idea of a chain reaction, implying that if one thing happens, then another, usually horrible thing will also happen     | Example: We must have harsher laws against speeding. Otherwise, people will start treating our highways like the Indy 500 track, and thousands will get killed!  |
| Ad Hominem                | focuses on a person, rather than on evidence                                                                                     | Example: Of course Ms. Liu must be guilty of the charge of neglecting that poor poodle. She is a cruel person who hates animals.                                 |
| False Dilemma             | implies that there are a limited number of possible explanations or solutions when, in reality, there are many more              | Example: Either we must continue to fight this war, or we must surrender. Surrender is not an acceptable option, so we must fight to the death.                  |
