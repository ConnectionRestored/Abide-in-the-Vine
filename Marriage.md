# Marriage
## Lessons of Genesis
### Creation
[[Gen 1#26]]
[[Gen 1#27]]
[[Gen 1#28]]
- He created man in his image
- He gives human authority
- He gives human a command: to fill the earth

### The Two Trees
[[Gen 2#8]]
[[Gen 2#9]]
- Two trees are created, and we cannot eat the Tree of Good and Evil -> Humans are created, even with the authority and prillege given.

### How God created woman
- Man are to complement woman.
- Man are designed to work in harmony.

### A glimpse of that "goodness"
- Look at the first time someone first met their beloved.

## Characteristics
![[Ephes 5#31]]
![[Ephes 5#32]]
![[Ephes 5#33]]

- Marriage is not about you and me, it's to reflect God's image
- Marriage is covenantal - it is lifelong
	- Not designed to keep until things get hard
	- Not designed to be temporary until someone better comes
- There is no "perfect match" - that's a myth
- Marriage is **not** easy.
- 
### The Problem with Marriage
- Reason sin - specifically *pride* and *disobedience* ([[Gen 3#1|Genesis 3:1-6]][[Gen 3#2|]][[Gen 3#3|]][[Gen 3#4|]][[Gen 3#5|]][[Gen 3#6|]])
	- Their actions after they sinned: Adam blamed Eve, Eve blamed the serpent. Worst yet, Adam blamed God. / They blame others to justify their sins.
	- Consequences of sin 
		- Work became hard
		- Woman will be in huge pain in conception
		- **Marriage relationships were broken**
			- [[Gen 3#16]] - Woman will try to control man, even though God's design is for man to be leaders of the family.
		- Man has to die. ([[Gen 3#19|Gen 3#19a]])
			- Insight: God removes Adam and Eve out of the garden, so that they might not eat the Tree of Life and live in the cursed state forever.
		- We have an enemy: Satan
			- He is a liar, just like he did with Eve.
			-> Remember that we have an enemy, but don't forget about our sinful nature.
## Practical applications of biblical knowledge
### Selfishness
- We all sinned and became selfish - desiring things that are not God's value.
	-> We need Christ, the workings of God's Spirit in our hearts and our relationships with God. Slowly but surely, desiring things that God desires in us.
- Remember 2 things
	- [[Prov 4#23]]
	- I threaterns my marriage most.
		- Start with ourselves, not our partner when we have difficulties.
		- When there is a problem, usually both parties caused it.
			- Normal situation
				- [[Prov 4#23]]
					- At church, we know lots of important things. But, its more about knowing, its about application.
					- We do right things but we don't actually love doing the right things. 
					- Focus on not just knowing the right things. Not just doing the right things. But also loving the right things.
					- Focus on the motivation of the work. Not the work itself.
					- If we sin in the hearts - that's poison and will poison our marriage.
				- [[Matt 6#33]]
					- Seek God first! Seek His values first!
				- [[Ephes 5#21]] - [[Ephes 5#33]] SO IMPORTANT FOR MARRIAGE!
					- What do husbands need to do?
						- "Love your wives" [[Ephes 5#25]]
							- Not feelings though!! It's much much deeper.
							- "...husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies" [[Ephes 5#28]]
								- I need to care for my wife.
						- This is an urge for live-long commitment.
					- What do wives need to do?
						- "the wife must respect her husband" [[Ephes 5#33]]
							- It weakens the family, the husband don't feel confident. 
							- It's impossible to lead a family if the wife don't respect the husband.
						- Respect has to be met with love.
					- Living in a Christian marriage needs faith - we need God and rely on him.
						- For husbands:
							- What do God wants me to do?
							- God will hold us and our actions accountable.
						- For wives:
							- Trust in God - Trust in the man God chose for her.
						- We need to the humble, soft-hearted - and seek God in order to have a God-honoring marriage.
							- Say sorry when we need. 
						- 
				- Application
					- How we converse with our spouses
						- Two words to throw away: always - never
						- When using these words, we are communicating that a person never change - cannot change.
						- We are attacking the character of a person.
						- Instead, describe specific actions. 
						- Describe our feelings
							- The focus is on the root of hurt, not attacking another person.
							- A way to share your feelings without attacking another person.
			- Abusive situation
				- Description
					- We are endangered physically, emotionally, or even spiritually. 
					- Our children are not safe.
				- You don't have to have accept it. You can take actions.
				- Create safety (by God's grace and help) for us and our children.
				- From that boundary, work to restore the marriage.
