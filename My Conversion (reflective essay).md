# My Conversion (reflective essay)

"Just type this into your browser..."

My 8-year-old self listened intently and with curiosity to what a friend of mine said, not knowing where doing so would take me. Looking back, I can imagine a room with a computer sitting neatly on a desk, waiting, perhaps anxiously, for its owner to command it to do something.

"What would I see?" I wondered.

My tiny fingers typed what my friend said to the computer. Tap, tap, click. Following that click, I was introduced to one of humanity's worst inventions: pornography.

As the days passed after that moment, I continued to look up the same keywords in secret while disguising myself to be a fine kid: putting on good grades and proper behavior. Religion was added on top of that: church, Sunday schools, summer camps, and the occasional prayer. I know what I'm hiding is wrong, but there's something about it that appeals to me. Something enticing. Something engrossing. Overtime, I got better at finding and accessing this type of content. I saw everything, from still photos to videos.

"Yea, have a good time!"

My twelve-year-old self said to my parents as they walked out of the apartment, trying to hide my excitement and eagerness: I would be home alone, with no one to peer in as I watched porn on the home television. Another time, I obtained access to an account on this website that allows you to interact with the content displayed. In short, I was addicted, and there was no way out.

But then came the morning. It began like any other morning: I awoke and went to my room to do some exercises.

"Finally, that's done."

I exclaimed, sweat streaming down my brow. In this moment of celebration, a strong urge surfaced, and I gave in to it. If there was ever a time to do this, it was now: my mother was preparing breakfast, my father was working in another room, and my younger brother was sleeping. I locked the door and turned on incognito mode. Tap, tap, enter. A few moments of captivation followed, and then came dread. I saw a cross there. What? A rugged cross, standing firm against a gloaming reddish background. That was one man's interpretation of the phrase "The sun stopped shining." This is the place where Jesus, whom I had learned so much about in religion, died for my sins. I don't remember exactly how the cross looked, but it was blood-soaked in history, with the blood of a sinless man dying for every sinful human.

"Why is it here?"

God touched my heart at that precise moment. I immediately closed the browser window, stunned. It was not an attempt to conceal my sin, but rather an effort to eliminate it from my life once and for all. I know God did something because I now despise the thing that once captivated me. That was the last time I looked at pornography, and I will never look at it again.

God did more than just save me from pornography; he also gave me a heart transplant. I now love the things God loves and detest the things he detests. Instead of being enslaved to sin, I am now free to do what is right. In my life, there is happiness, purpose, and hope. I'm done with religion; I now have an intimate relationship with the one true God. When I had a quiz, it was no longer an opportunity to cheat; it was an opportunity to glorify God!

*This event marked a complete 180 degrees turn for my life, without me doing absolutely nothing to help make that turn.*


"But, did I deserve it?"

No. How could I possibly deserve it? How can a morally corrupt fornicator claim to deserve any of this?

"But then, why?"

God is gracious, and that is why he has shown me grace. He sent His Son to die for me in order to pay the penalty for my sins. And through Jesus, God's grace flowed to me. It's because God is gracious, not because I deserved it. It's just who he is.
