# My Conversion (reflective essay)

"Just type this into your browser..."

An friend of mine told me as my 8-year-old self listened carefully and curiously; not knowing where doing so would lead me. Though there is no clear images in my mind, I can imagine a room with a computer sitting neatly on a desk, waiting, maybe anxiously, what its owner would do to it. I too was anxious: "What would I see?" My minuscule-fingers typed what my friend told me to the computer. Tap, tap, click. After that click, I was introduced to one of the worst human invention: pornography.

Day by day, I kept searching up the same keywords while disguising myself as a fine kid: putting on good grades and proper behaviors. Added to that was religion: church, sunday schools, summer camps, the occasional prayers. I know what I am hiding was wrong, but there's something about it. Something alluring. Something gripping. After many tries, I grow more and more proficient at finding and accessing these type of content. I saw them all, from still images to videos. 

"Yea, have a good time!"

I says to my parent as they walk out and I locked the door, trying to hide the excitement and eagerness that submerge me: I would be home-alone, with no one to peek in as I used the home television to watch porn. Another time, I got my hands on an account to this site that let you interact with the content shown. In short, I was addicted.

But then, a morning came. It started like any normal morning: I woke up and go to my room have some exercises. 

"Finally, that's done."

I said as I gasped, sweat falls from my brow. It was in this moment of celebration that an urge to look at porn arose, and I yielded to it. If there was a perfect time to do this, it was now: mom's cooking breakfast, dad's working and brother's sleeping. Locking door, igcognito mode, tap, tap, enter. A few moment of captivation, and then dread. I saw a cross. What? A rugged cross, standing firmly on a gloaming grayish background. There are no other words to describe the scene: "The sun stopped shining." This is where Jesus, the one whom I learned so much about in religion, died here for my sins. I don't remember precisely how the cross looked, but in history, that cross was blood-soaked, with the blood of an sinless man, dying for every sinful human.

That's when God touched and transformed my heart. Shocked, I immediately closed the browser window. It was not an attempt to hide my sin, but in an attempt to cut it out of my life. After that moment, I now hate the thing that once enthralled me. That's was the last time I ever looked at pornography, and I will not ever again.

God did more than delivering me from pornography, though, he gave me a heart transplant. I now love the things that God loves, and hate the things that God hates. I'm now free to do what is right, rather than enslaved to sin. There is joy, there is purpose, there is hope in my life. I'm done with religion, I now have a intimate relationship with the one true God. Everytime I have a quiz, it wasn't a opportunity to cheat anymore, it was an opportunity to glorify God! 

"But, did I deserve it?"

No. How can I deserve it? How can a morally-depraved fornicator says that he deserves any of this?

"But then, why?"

God is gracious, and that's why He shown me grace. 
He gave His Son to die for me, to pay the penalty for my sins. And through Jesus, God's grace flowed to me. Not because I deserved it, but because God is gracious. It's just who He is. And if He had shown me grace then, why would He stop showing me grace now?
