# What?
- A **lens** is any object that are shaped in a way that [[refraction (physics)|refract]] light so that an image is formed.
- It's quite like a [[Mirrors (physics)|mirror]].

# Types of Lens
## Converging Lens

- Opposite of mirrors, *convex* lens are actually *converging lens.*
### Rules of Converging Lens

1. A ray that comes into the lens parallel to the principal axis will refract through the lens and travel through the focal point.
2.  A ray that comes through the focal point on the way to the lens will refract and travel parallel to the principal axis on the other side.
3.  A ray that passes through the center (i.e. the principal axis) will continue traveling in that same direction.

## Diverging Lens

- Opposite of mirrors, *concave* lens are actually *diverging lens.*
### Rules of Diverging Lens

1.  A ray that comes in to the lens parallel to the principle axis will refract in a direction so that the extension of the ray in front of the lens passes through the focal point on the same side of the lens as the object.
2.  A ray that travels toward the focal point on the other side of the lens will refract so that the ray travels parallel to the principal axis.
3.  A ray that passes through the center of the lens will continue in that same direction.
