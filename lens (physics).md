# What?
- A **lens** is any transparent object that are shaped in a way that [[refraction (physics)|refract]] light so that an image is formed.
- It's quite like a [[Mirrors (physics)|mirror]].
# Types of Lens
## Converging Lens
![[Pasted image 20221018163907.png|500]]
- Opposite of mirrors, *convex* lens are actually *converging lens.*
### Rules of Converging Lens
![[Pasted image 20221018164044.png|450]]
1. A ray that comes into the lens parallel to the principal axis will refract through the lens and travel through the focal point.
2.  A ray that comes through the focal point on the way to the lens will refract and travel parallel to the principal axis on the other side.
3.  A ray that passes through the center (i.e. the principal axis) will continue traveling in that same direction.

## Diverging Lens

- Opposite of mirrors, *concave* lens are actually *diverging lens.*
### Rules of Diverging Lens
![[Pasted image 20221018164745.png|450]]
1.  A ray that comes in to the lens parallel to the principle axis will refract in a direction so that the extension of the ray in front of the lens passes through the focal point on the same side of the lens as the object.
2.  A ray that travels toward the focal point on the other side of the lens will refract so that the ray travels parallel to the principal axis.
3.  A ray that passes through the center of the lens will continue in that same direction.

# Lens Equations

> [!warning] Working with Lens
> While working with lens, the image distance works opposite the way it does with mirrors. When it is negative, the image is created in front of the lens. When it is positive, it is created behind the lens.

## Lens Equation
> [!warning] Working with Diverging Lens
> The focal length of diverging lens are always **negative.**


$$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{s_o} + \frac{1}{s_i}$$
With:
- $s_o$ = object distance
- $s_i$ = image distance
- $f$ = focal length

Results:
| Variable | Positive (+) | Negative (-)  |
|:--------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
|   $f$    |   converging    |    diverging     |
|  $s_i$   |  real image  | virtual image |

## Lens Magnification Equation
$$M = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = \frac{-s_i}{s_o}$$
With:
- $s_o$ = object distance
- $s_i$ = image distance
- $h_o$ = object height
- $h_i$ = image height

Results:
|       M       |     Type of Image     |
|:-------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Positive (+) |        upright        |
|  Negative (-) |        inverted       |
| 0 < \|M\| < 1 | smaller than original |
|   \|M\| > 1   |  larger than original |


# Known image properties
## For converging (convex) lens
### **Object distance:** between $f$ and $2f$. 
![[Pasted image 20221018165415.png|350]]
**Image:**
- Inverted
- Larger
- Real
### **Object distance:** outside $2f$. 
![[Pasted image 20221018165439.png|350]]
**Image:**
- Inverted
- Smaller
- Real
### **Object distance:** inside $f$.
![[Pasted image 20221018165531.png|350]]
**Image:**
- Upright
- Larger
- Virtual

## For diverging lens
![[Pasted image 20221018165747.png|350]]
> [!tip] The image of Diverging Lens
> All diverging lenses produce the same type of image: virtual, upright, and smaller. The image is also always located on the same side of the lens as the object.
