### Step 1: What is the big idea of a story (as in a prose) or imagery (as in a poem)?
- What are the parts of the original story that are critical to its message? 
- What are the emotional content present in this work?
- Who or what is this work about?
- What elements are so important that it appears in both the original work and its representation?
### Step 2: What are the differences between the original work and its representation?
### Step 3: Why did the directors of representations made changes to original work as they did?
- Because each medium has its limitations, directors has to make changes to the original work in order to "convert" it to his/her desired medium.
