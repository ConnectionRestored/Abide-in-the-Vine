### #Definition 
- elements that directly or indirectly support the claim
- Examples: summaries of events, characterization, dialogue, or the narrator's point of view...
- There are two types of textual evidences, explicit and implicit:
	- explicit details clearly and directly illustrate a point, while implicit details are merely implied or suggested--not directly stated.

> [!Info] Extra evidences
> You may find additional evidence to support your claim by researching information about the work, its author, and the place and time in which the work was written.

> [!Tip] Paraphrasing
> Paraphrase or quote your textual evidences. Paraphrasing not only ensures that your work is original; it also helps you integrate the details from the text into your essay in a way that's easy for readers to follow
