### The steps to find the claim
- An analytical essay builds an argument about what the text means and how the elements of the story, poem, or play work together to express that meaning.
- The steps on analyzing a literary work:
	- **Read and re-read:** Become deeply familiar with the piece of literature you're analyzing. Read it closely more than once, so you feel you really know it.
	- **Highlight and annotate:** As you read, highlight repeating patterns, important events, and other striking elements. Jot down your own observations, personal connections, or questions in the margins. Look for details related to these key literary elements: setting, character, point of view, plot, symbols, imagery, figures of speech, and narrative or lyrical structure. Remember that these elements will vary by genre and from one work to another.
	- **[[Main idea#Identifying the main idea and theme of a work of literature MOCS Language Arts 10B | Identifying the Main Idea]]:** Ask yourself: What big messages or themes does the writer try to communicate in this work? You may notice more than one theme. Focus on the idea that seems the most important or that intrigues you the most.
	- **Draw conclusions:** Review your observations, connections, and questions about the key literary elements. Ask yourself: Which of these elements work together to develop the big idea? Write down any conclusions you come to.
