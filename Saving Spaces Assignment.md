What a joyous place

The church, what a joyous place.
The church, where we praise the Almighty.
The church, hymns from the heart are sung.
The church, where the Most High is glorified.

The pulpit, where God's Word is made known.
The pulpit, where Truth is revealed.
The pulpit, where a child is filled with awe,
At the sight of Light's great brilliance
The pulpit, where a famished soul is filled
With the bread of life from heaven.

The congregation, where fellowship are pure.
The congregation, where laughters are filled with true Joy.
The congregation, where our contrasts are
inferior to the oneness we have in Christ.

The church, not the building, but the people
The "church," the people of God,
remember that you were bought with a price
His own blood
His own blood
And make sure you do your purpose, to glorify Him,
Glorify Him
Glorify Him

### Explain how your specific word choice impacts meaning and tone in your poem.
When I wrote this poem, I wanted to convey how precious the church is in a joyful tone. The word choice here evokes a sense of wonder and awe while also encouraging readers to treasure the church for what happens within it. Words like "joyous," "praise," "awe," and "brilliance" are sprinkled throughout the poem to achieve the desired tone. To emphasize a point, words like "famished" and "contrasts" are used. In the case of "famished," it is quickly followed by the word "filled," illustrating how the church is the place where souls are made alive by listening to the exposition of God's word. In the case of the word "contrasts," it is used to emphasize the differences between congregation members. These distinctions are then further contrasted with the truth in the following line: "[the differences are] inferior to the oneness we have in Christ." These two lines of the third stanza combine to highlight how beautiful and unusual a church's congregation is, supporting the poem's claim.

### Describe the poetic devices or techniques you used to communicate your ideas about the place
The poem's flow is created by alliteration and rhythm generated by the use of repetition throughout. The flow adds to a sense of excitement and cherishment that the poem intends to convey about the church. "What a joyous place" also relies heavily on images to prove that the church is a very precious place. The most important role of a church building is to be a location where believers meet to worship God. In the first stanza, though not plainly described, what was written will cause the readers to use their background knowledge and build an image for themselves: a congregation of believers, raising their hands and singing from their hearts, without lies or distraction. To all believers, it is a very beautiful image, and it also display how precious the church is. In the second stanza, the pulpit is depicted as a place where God's (Light's) beauty is radiated in all of its brillance because its where expositions of the Bible is given. The imagery drawn in the second stanza is an picture of a child in utter awe when he/she sees a sunrise for the first time, just like the congregation (the child in this case) is in awe when they see who God really are and what He has done. Each images in this poem are like an argument supporting the poem's claim: the church is precious. Each ignites that sense of "wow," and each urges one to treasure the church. More than just generating the poem's flow, the repetition of words and paralleism in structure also helps emphasizes the worth of the church or who/what is in it by continually pointing it out by name and describing a wondrous thing that happen in it or its characteristics. In the last stanza, the repetition of 2 phrases -- "His own blood" and "Glorify Him" -- is meant to create an "echo," instilling the point into the readers' mind even after the reader finishes reading the poem. It serves as an conclusion and call-to-action. The church is precious because it were bought by Christ's precious blood, and outflowing from that worth come the only reasonable response: to glorify God.

The flow of the poem is created by alliteration and the rhythm that is generated by the use of repetition throughout. The flow contributes to the poem's intended tone of excitement and cherishment for the church. "What a joyous place" also heavily relies on images to demonstrate how important the church is. The most important function of a church building is to serve as a gathering place for believers to worship God. Though not explicitly described, what was written in the first stanza will cause readers to use their prior knowledge to construct an image for themselves: a congregation of believers, raising their hands and singing from their hearts, without lies or distraction. It is a very beautiful image for all believers, and it also shows how valuable the church is. The pulpit is depicted in the second stanza as a place where God's (Light's) beauty is radiated in all of its brillance because it is where Bible expositions are given. The imagery in the second stanza depicts a child in awe when he or she sees a sunrise for the first time, just as the congregation ("the child") is in awe when they see who God truly is and what He has done. Each image in this poem serves as an argument for the poem's main point: the church is precious. More than just generating the poem's flow, parallelism helps to emphasize the value of the church or who or what is in it by repeatedly naming it and describing a wondrous thing that happens in it or its characteristics. The repetition of two phrases in the final stanza—"His own blood" and "Glorify Him"—is intended to create an "echo," instilling the point in the reader's mind even after they have finished reading the poem. It is both a conclusion and a call to action. The church is valuable because it was purchased with Christ's precious blood, and the benefits that flow from that value are numerous. The church is valuable because it was bought with Christ's precious blood, and the only logical response to that fact is to glorify God.

When describing the congregation engaged 

- Images
	- There are at least 1 imagery in each stanza of this poem.
	- "The congregation, where laughters are filled with true Joy."
		- The imagery makes the connection between a church's congregation and a family conversation. Everyone's smilling, but their smiles are not brittle joy, but true Joy that comes from Jesus and the fellowship his congregation has in him.
	- The pulpit, where a child is filled with awe,
       At the sight of Light's great brilliance
       - The Bible talks about God, who he is and what he do. When the word of God is made known to his people, the congregation ("a child") is filled with awe at the radiating brightness of God's (Light's) character and actions.
   - When Jesus died on the cross, he shed his own blood for our sins. When a beliver is reminded of the "blood of Christ," he remembers how high the price did God pay for his salvation.
   - Each of the images in this poem are like 1 argument supporting the poem's claim: the church is precious. Each ignites that sense of "wow," and each urges one to treasure the church.
