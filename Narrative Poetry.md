### #Definition
- Narrative poetry joins the best of a story and poetry, creating a gripping story in a musical and compressed language.
- The poem's feelings are expressed through line breaks, rhythm, and sound effects.
- The mood of a narrative poetry are caused by the sounds and rhythm of words just as it is with the words' meanings.

### Analyzing Narrative Poetry
- [[Poetic Devices | Poets use music techniques to increase the power of their words.]]
- Steps on how to analyze a narrative poem:
	- 1: Make sure you understand the poem's story on a literal level.
		- With any narrative poem, first make sure you understand what's happening. Some poems narrate events in a straightforward way. A long narrative poem may have a conventional plot structure, while a short poem may relate a simple sequence of events.
	- 2: Examine word choice in the poem. What language does the poet use to explore the events?
		- In a narrative poem, word choice and imagery are usually just as important to the meaning of the poem as the events of the narrative.
	- 3: Note any ways in which the structure and language of the poem enhance the storytelling.
		- When you read a narrative poem, consider how line breaks, the ordering of events, and poetic devices help build suspense or add an element of surprise.
	- 4: Explain how narrative, structure, and poetic devices combine to help create the meaning of the poem.
		- Finally, put your observations together to make a statement about the theme of the poem. How do the events of the narrative and the poet's choice of words combine to express a message about life?
