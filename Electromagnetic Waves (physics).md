- Electromagnetic Waves are waves that can travel without an medium.
- They are called *electromagnetic* waves because they are produced by electric ch Each spectrum is broken off to smaller spectra with different characteristics of how they intreract with matter.arges that are vibrating.
	- They have two components that travel at right angles of each other: an *electric component* and an *magnetic component.*
## Electromagnetic spectrum

- Each spectrum is broken off to smaller spectra with different characteristics of how they intreract with matter.
- The [[visible light (physics)]] makes up a small portion of the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
