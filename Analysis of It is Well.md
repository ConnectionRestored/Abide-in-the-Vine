> [!Info] Purpose
> This hymn analysis was done as part of my [[MOCS Language Arts 10B]] course, but it is done with the sole intention to glorify God!

Theme: Salvation, Hope.

Main idea: No matter the circumstances, no matter our sins, because of the salvation in Christ, it is well with our souls.

Claim: In his hymn "It is Well," Spafford expresses the hope, and comfort that he has in Christ.

### Background
> Detailing the lost that's the author suffered

- A laywer and partner with a large law firm.
- Successful, with much investment to Chicago's real estate.
- Father to 4 beautiful daughters.
- But everything where taken from him
	- Investment: Great Chicago Fire
	- 4 daughters: Ville du Havre
	- His wife was the only survivor after the tragedy.
- Amidst his horrible lost, because of Christ and the hope and peace that comes from His salvation, Spafford refrains: "It is well, It is well, with my soul."
-> By the background alone, a logical claim can be made about the poem: In his hymn "It is Well," Spafford expresses the hope and peace that Christ's salvation brings to him.

### Tone
Despite the hardships faced, the tone of this hymn is light-hearted. The author didn't meditate upon his lost, instead, he looks to Christ for hope and peace.

### Mood from the repetition
The chorus, or refrain of this hymn breaks the line "It is well, it is well, with my soul" to different parts and sing over each one. From this repetition, the author not only expresses how real and tangible his hope and peace is, but also "extends" that feelings to his readers.

### Hope from the repetition
The word "soul" ends every stanzas. The author stresses why he still has hope. His hope and peace is not in optimism that his grieved mental state will get better over time. Nor is it that he will earn back his lost wealth. His hope is in the spiritual world.

#### Use of Parralel Structures

	When peace like a river attendeth my way
	When sorrows like sea billows roll
	
	Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,  
	...
	That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,  
	And hath shed His own blood for my soul.  
	
	My sin, not in part but the whole,  
	Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,  
	Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!  

Parralelism appears throughout this hymn. These parralel structures has 2 purposes, one is to display that Spafford's hope and peace is unconditional to the circumstances, the other is to express that joy that he has when he contemplate that day, when he will see the face of Christ face-to-face.

At the start of the first and second stanzas, the use of parralel structures highlights that Spafford's hope and peace is unconditional to the circumstances. Whether at peace or filled with sorrows, attacked by Satan or going through trials of faith, it is still well with his soul. One may wonder, "how could it be well?" To that he answers with another pair of parralel structure, as too further impress the point: "That Christ has regarded my helpless estate, / And hath shed His own blood for my soul." It's because of Christ, its because of his salvation, that his soul is well.

Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!  
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul.  
...
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,  
A song in the night, oh my soul!

The parallelism in line "Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!" and how it is paralleled, not in grammatical structure but in meaning here in this line "The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend," expresses to the readers how joyous the author is when thinking about Christ's second coming. This shows how comforting the truth that Jesus will come again,

### Imagery
While reading the hymn, one find it hard to notice the vivid imagery present. To me, these images and how they force readers to imagine and sense what is being described show how real the sorrow of life can be, but at the same time how real the hope in Christ is.  

One may wonder what "Jordan" meant in "If Jordan above me shall roll." It is quiet a profound imagery. The Jordan is a river in Israel that connects the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. Traditionally, the expression "crossing over the Jordan" is a metaphor for passing from death to eternal life. When the Jordan is described as to be above the author, it meant that he is experiencing death. The following lines explain the peace that he has in Christ's salvation: while suffering through death, he suffers no pang, for its just the same as living, Jesus whispers peace to his soul.

Even more than captivating the readers, Stafford has a specific purpose for describing this following scene: "Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!... The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend." 
This is an promise from the Bible (1 Thessalonians 4:16) telling how Christ will return once more. By repeating this imagery two times, the author shows his firm hope that Christ will return, and find comfort in that thought.

### Structure
All the different elements of this poem are combined with a beautiful structure to press home the point. In the first 3 stanzas, the author finds joy and hope in the past: what Christ has done. But in the last 3 stanzas, the author find joy and hope in the future: what Christ will be doing.

### Counter-claim
After the horrible hardship, Spafford soul must be in much grieved. As a Christian, Spafford meant that because his soul will be in heaven, and not in hell, "It is well [with his soul.]" Everytime it is said, "It is well," the author is looking to the future for hope.
