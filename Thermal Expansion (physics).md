# What?
- When the molecules warms up, they get further apart and cause the object to expand. This concept is *thermal expansion.*
	- The reverse is true, when an object cools, it contracts.

# Examples
- Two examples, one is thermal expansion in action in bi-metallic strips, another is thermal expansion in action in a ball and ring can be found [here](https://ideal.accelerate-ed.com/pub/a/ib/-/lo/5c2b76a5-1f9f-41a7-a6c9-0c5328b51bcf/p/104af0f9-9b10-4c92-a707-529f081bfe7f?workflowtype=CmsLesson&speechstream=true&speechstreammode=collapsed).
# Thermal Expansion uniqueness in water
### What?
- Normally, as a substance grows hotter, it expanses. But, in the case of water, when its temperature increases from $0^\circ C$ to $4^\circ C$, it actually contracts.
### Why?
- Water molecules in solid form (Ice) actually occupy a greater volume than water molecules in Though liquids expand on heating, water does not expand between 0°C to 4°C instead it liquid form, making ice less dense than liquid water. When the temperature decreases, the water on top actually freezes first.
- Water is most dense at $4^\circ C$, so when its temperature increases from $0^\circ C$ to $4^\circ C$, it actually contracts.
### God's design
- God designed it to be like so to allow fish and marine life to survive during cold temperatures when water freezes.
