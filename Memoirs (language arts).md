### #Definition 
- A memoir is a specific genre of [[Autobiography (language arts) | autobiographical]] writing that exhibits several other features beyond a simple and direct description of one's life.
- Typically, a memoir develops one theme by describing certain aspects of the author's life. Instead of describing every year of a person's life.
	- a memoir may focus on one significant stretch of time--such as an athlete's professional basketball career--or it may recount only those incidents that are relevant to the theme.

### Why would authors choose to write memoirs instead of autobigraphies?
- The shorter, more limited form of a memoir allows an author to focus on one major theme or area of concern in his or her life.

### Analyzing Memoirs / Identifying a memoirs' theme:
- The theme of an autobiographical narrative reveals itself through the effect of events on a character’s development.
