### Lyrics

Oh Lord, you're beautiful,
Your face is all I seek,
And when your eyes are on this child,
Your grace abounds to me.
Oh Lord, you're beautiful,
Your face is all I seek,
And when your eyes are on this child,
Your grace abounds to me.

I want to take your word and shine it all around. First help me just to live it Lord.
And when I'm doing well, help me to never seek a crown.
For my reward is bringing glory to you.

I want to take your word and shine it all around.
But first help me just to live it Lord.
And when I'm doing well, help me to never seek a crown.
For my reward is giving glory to you.

Oh Lord, you're beautiful,
Your face is all I seek,
For when your eyes are on this child,
Your grace abounds to me.

Oh Lord, you're beautiful,
Your face is all I seek,
For when your eyes are on this child,
Your grace abounds to me.
