# Genesis Studies
#### Interesting notes
[[Gen 1]] - Everytime that God created something, He said in cloze form. But, when He created us humans, He said His command in poetry. This expresses [[Poetry in the Bible | God's love for us, from His heart to ours.]] Wow!

[[Gen 8]] - God answered my prayer for insight once again!!!! Praise God! Here, in v.13, it was said that "Noah removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry." There was a thought in my mind that says 

[[Gen 22#5]] and [[Gen 22#6]] - Abraham didn't allow the servant to take Isaac back to his homeland because he didn't want Isaac to leave the Promised Land - which God promised that He will give to Abraham and his decendants. This act is an act of faith.
