Narrator: “Just type this into your browser..."

Narrator: My 9-year-old self listened intently and curiously to what a friend of mine said, not knowing where doing so would take me. I was so young I can’t remember all the details. Looking back, I can only imagine with uncertainty our family living room, with a computer neatly placed on a desk, eagerly awaiting its owners’ commands to do something. Did I pause for a moment to consider what I might see? I’m not sure. What I was sure of, though, is that my tiny fingers did look up what my friend said on the computer. After that click, I was introduced to one of humanity's most heinous inventions: pornography.

Narrator: One glance was all it took to hook me. As time passed, I continued to look up the same keywords in secret while getting better at finding this type of content. I was exposed to everything, from still photos to 40-minute videos. One reason why I didn’t get caught was because, from the outside, I was a fine kid. I had good grades and proper behavior. On top of that was religion: church, Sunday schools, summer camps, and mindlessly repeated prayers. I know it's wrong, but there's something about pornography that I find appealing. Something enticing. Something alluring. Slowly, I became ensnared in these fantasies—without even realizing it.

Narrator: "Yes, yes."

Narrator: My twelve-year-old self would say half-heartedly, to my parents as they walked out of our apartment, trying to hide my excitement at the prospect of being alone at home with no one peering in while I watched porn on the home television. One time, I even got my hand on this website, which allows you to interact with the displayed content by prompting you to choose what the actors would do. Another thing I did was join these group chats where people would post pornography on – turning the chat history into a burbling stream of charms – and scroll through them like a social media feed. While writing this essay, I can still vividly remember how I accessed pornography in one window while Zoom was open in another during an online biology class. There is no need for additional proof; I got addicted to pornography, and no one could save me from this snare because no one knew I was one.

A man’s voice: “Josh, who will you be when you grow up with that little secret cemented to your life? 

A woman’s voice: "Yea, and what do you do when your parents have no say over what you do or where you go?"

Narrator: But then came the morning. It started like any other morning: after waking up, I went to my room to do some exercises.

Narrator: "Finally, that's done."

Narrator: I exclaimed, with sweat streaming down my brow. It was in this moment of celebration that an urge surfaced, and I gave in to it. If there was ever a time to do this, it was now: my mother was preparing breakfast, my father was working in another room, and my younger brother was sleeping. First, I locked the door. Then, turning to the computer, I turned on incognito mode. A few dopamine rushes followed, only to be quickly replaced with horror. I saw a cross. What? A rugged cross, standing firm and mute against a gloaming reddish background. This is the place where Jesus, whom I had learned so much about in religion, died an excruciating death for my sins. I don't remember exactly how the cross looked, but it was blood-soaked in history, with the blood of a sinless man dying for every sinful human.

Narrator: "Why is it on this site?"

Narrator: At this exact moment, God transformed my coarse heart. Stunned, I immediately closed the browser window, not to hide my sin, but to eliminate it from my life. I don’t know exactly how he did it, but that was the last time I looked at pornography, and I'm not going to look at it again.

Narrator: At that precise moment, God miraculously delivered me from the clutches of pornography. But he did more than that; he also gave me a new heart. I now love what God loves and despise what he despises. Rather than being bound by sin, I am now free to do what is right. Joy, purpose, and hope have replaced the previous lustful desires and haughty attitudes. I'm done with religion; I now have an intimate relationship with the one true God. When I had a quiz, it was no longer a chance to cheat; it was a chance to glorify God!

Narrator: This event - this moment - completely turned my life upside down for the better, and what was unique about it was that I had no role whatsoever in making it happen. It was all because of God’s grace, not because I deserved it. How can a morally corrupt fornicator claim to be deserving of any of this? It was because God is gracious; it's just who he is.

Narrator: “Looking forward to the future, you may have many dreams. Going to Harvard? Working for Google? But, Joshua, whatever you accomplish, big or small, remember that it was God's grace that brought you there.”
