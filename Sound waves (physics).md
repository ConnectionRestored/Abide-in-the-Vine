### #Definition
- Sound waves are [[Longtitudinal Wave | longtitudinal]], [[Mechanical Waves | mechanical waves]] produced by vibrations within objects. These vibrations cause disturbances in the medium around them causing longitudinal pressure waves.
	- E.g: Piano, guitar, vocal chords...
- These waves must come through the vibration of gas, liquid or solid. (They need a medium)
	- They are a series of compressions and rarefactions that disturb the medium.
- They are spherical and radiate out from the point source.

- Needs recheck: The wave pulse created goes out in three dimensions.

### How do you calculate the speed of different sound waves?
- Because sound waves work like any other mechanical wave, the [[Wave speed#formula The wave equation | wave equation]] can be used to calculate the speed of different sound waves
