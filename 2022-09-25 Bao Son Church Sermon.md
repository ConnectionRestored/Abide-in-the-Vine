Location: [[Bao Son Church]]
Preacher: [[Pastor Hung]]
Passage: [[Ps 139]]
Sermon type: [[Big Idea Preaching]]

We all want to be understood, we don't want to be alone. Psalm 139 will bring us encouragement.

This passage is living theology, not just knowledge theology.

This psalm can be separated to 4 different passages:
- 1 - 6: Only God knows us most (He knows everything!)
	- Not only He has the ability to know, He wants to know!
		- Our thought process (v.4 - God thoroughly understand our words)
		- Our sleep position
	- The worship of this wonderful truth: v6
	> The truth revealed here both gives us hope, but both gives us reason to fear. He knows our goods, He also knows our bad.
- 7-12: (He is everywhere!)
	- 7 - 8: We can't hide from Him!
		- 9 - 10: An example to further stress the point.
		- 11 - 12: An further example to further stress the point!
	> The truth revealed here both gives us hope, but both gives us reason to fear. We are never alone, but if we were to sin, we will sin in His presence. That's horrible.
- 13 - 18: He woves us in our mothers' womb. He has a plan for us.
	- 13 - 15: The conception process is so MIRACULOUS! PRAISE GOD!
	- 16 - 18: He has a plan for our lives! Awesome!
		- But we need to colaborate with God in His plan!
			- The story of Ezekiel
			- Proverbs 10:27
		- The pastor's thought: This truth is not only true for each human, but for nations and countries, too.
		- Our thought process (the way we think) is very important
			- MOST IMPORTANT: How we think about God. We need to have correct thoughts about God.
				- Two most common ways that humans think about God:
					- Judge - Police
					- Too Forgiving - Kindness - Merciful
			- HIS WORD is the answer! How do we know God more? How do we think about God correctly? Frame Him correctly? **READ HIS WORD!**
			- Correct frame about God will impact all aspects of life, even our prayers!
- 21 - 24: He is just. He is holy.
	- This is the accumiliation of 3 passages above. He knows everything. He is everywhere. He created us in our mothers' womb. He has a plan for us. -> He will do justice.
	- 23-24: ending prayer
		- This is also the accumiliation of 3 passages above. He knows everything. He is everywhere. He created us in our mothers' womb. He has a plan for us. -> We need to live holy lives.
		- Asking for the One who knows everything to "examine" David, to "probe" his thoughts.
		- Asking for the One who is everywhere to "test" him, to "know his concerns".
		- Asking for the One who has a plan for us to see if there is any idolatrous way within him, and lead him in the everlasting way.

#### One sentence summary
He knows everything! He is everywhere! He woves us in our mothers' womb. He has a plan for us -> the wicked will be destroyed, but we ourselves need to be weary and live holy lives. How can we do that? We need to know God as He really is! PRAISE GOD!
