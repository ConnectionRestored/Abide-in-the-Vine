In Exodus and Leviticus, detailed descriptions about how a ram is slaughtered and then burnt as offerings is given. Looking to Jesus, he is our Sacrificial Ram.

![[1 Cor-05#v7]]

![[John-01#v29]]

He was pierced, He was "burned" on the cross, and He suffered it all for all of us. WOW that's grace, WOW that's love.
