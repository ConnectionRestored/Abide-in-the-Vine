# The Kingdom of Heaven
Passage: 

> [!Bible]  [Matthew 13:31-32 - ESV](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/ESV/40/13/)
> He put another parable before them, saying,  “The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.”
> [[Matt 13#31|]][[Matt 13#32|]]
- Is the kingdom of heaven, that is sown into our hearts, growing?
> [!Bible]  [Matthew 13:33 - ESV](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/ESV/40/13/)
> He told them another parable.  “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened.” [[Matt 13#33|]]
- Is is making our heart "leavened?"
	- Is the change noticable?
		- How contrasting our current (and future) actions with our past?
	- Is our lives outflowing the goodness of God?
> [!Bible]  [Matthew 13:44 - ESV](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/ESV/40/13/)
> “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. [[Matt 13#44|]]
- If we truly understand the glorious hope we have in Christ, we will trade everything for it.
	- We trade things we have **now,** so that we may have that "field" in the **future.**
- But, the reverse can happen? Will we trade our faith, will we trade our relationship with God, for anything of this world.
- Don't be like [[Gen 25#29|Esau]], trading his birthright (which will lead to the covenantal relationship with God).
> [!Bible]  [Matthew 13:45-46 - ESV](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/ESV/40/13/)
> “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls,who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.
- This parable have the same relative meaning with the last parable, but it's deeper. The merchant here must have a passion for their trade.
	- Loving the kingdom of heaven's characteristics.
	- We want to trade everything for the kingdom of heaven - because we love the King, God.
> [!Bible]  [Matthew 13:47-50 - ESV](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/ESV/40/13/)
> “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad.So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
- There will be judgement. Are we being counted in the **righteous group?**
- We should not judge: "Is he a good fish? Is he a bad fish?" We need to remove the log that is in our own eyes ([[Matt 7#3]])

## The Kingdom of Heaven starts from the heart.
- Heaven is in Jesus! Heaven is not a place, it is Jesus!
