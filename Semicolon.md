### #Definition

### Using Semicolons
> Maya finished packing; Angela loaded the moving truck.

A semicolon can join two similar word groups all by itself--no coordinating conjunction needed.

#### Using semicolons with [[Compound sentences]]
- A sentence that uses a semicolon is usually [[Compound sentences]].

#### Using semicolons with [[Adverbs]]
- The adverbs that can be used with semicolons include _thus, then, however, hence, indeed, accordingly, besides_, and _therefore_.
- Example: "Lorenzo slowly added a few drops of a weak acid to the mixture; then, he waited to see what sort of reaction might happen."

#### Using semicolons in lists
- to separate items in a list when some items have commas within them
- *cities and their states,* *dates* lists will always require semicolons.

### Errors while using semicolons
- The clauses that you join with a semicolon need to be closely related to each other in meaning. Otherwise, you should write the clauses as two separate complete sentences.
- If the adverb appears in a sentence with just one independent clause, commas--not semicolons--are the correct way to set the adverb apart from the rest of the sentence.

### Differences between Semicolons and [[Colon]]
The semicolon joins two word groups that are very similar in meaning and also parallel in structure. The colon joins two word groups that are much less alike. They are related in meaning, but one group explains or illustrates the other.
