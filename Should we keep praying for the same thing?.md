**What prompted me to write this question?**
Sometimes, I find myself wanting to pray for the same thing, but there are a sense of resistance from my heart. I'm not sure if it pleases God or not for us to repeatedly ask for something - I think he does, given what Jesus had said in [[Luke-11#v9]] - [[Luke-11#v13]].

**Have you asked God first?**
Yes, I have.
