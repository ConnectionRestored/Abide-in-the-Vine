### #Definition
- Sound intensity is the rate at which energy is transferred through an area. 

### Calculating the sound intensity
$$I = \frac{P}{Area}=\frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$$
With:
- $P$: power (W)
- $r$ distance from point source.
- Units: $\frac{W}{m^2}$ 
	- Sometimes, the units can be in a *relative intensity* called decibels (dB) too! Relative intensity relates the sound intensity relative to the threshold of hearing. So, 0 decibels is barely audible. Each increase in 10 decibels is equivalent to 10 times the intensity of the previous rating
		- whisper = 30 dB
		-   vacuum cleaner = 70 dB
		-   pain threshold = 120 bB
		-   jet airplane engine = 150 dB
		- Remember, the decibel is a **logarithmic scale**, so each increase or decrease of 10 is a factor of 10. A decrease of 20 dB, is a decrease of a factor of 100 in intensity
