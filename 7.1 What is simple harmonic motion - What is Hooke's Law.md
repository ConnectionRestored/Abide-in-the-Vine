# What is simple harmonic motion? 
**Key words:** simple harmonic motion, mass-spring system, Hooke's Law, simple pendulum, oscillation, restoring force, period.

[[What is periodic motion?]]
- **Periodic motion** is defined as any repetitive motion that happens in equal intervals of time.
- There are many different types of Periodic motion
- [[Simple harmonic motion definition]]: **Simple harmonic motion (SHM)** is any type of periodic motion that moves back and forth across an equilibrium point in which a restoring force is proportional to the displacement from that equilibrium point. (SHM is the periodic motion that results from a restoring force.)
	- [[The result of Simple harmonic motion:]] oscillation (back-and-forth motion)
	- The force in a SHM is constantly changing as it is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium point, which is constantly changing.
	- [[Restoring force definition]] Restoring force acts to pull an object in a Simple harmonic motion back to the equilibrium.
- What a motion needs to be a SHM
	- At the equilibrium position, the speed reaches its maximum.
	- At maximum displacement (amplitude), the restoring force is greatest, and acceleration reaches maximum.
	- In SHM, the restoring force is proportional to displacement.

#### Example of a SHM in a Mass-spring system
![[Pasted image 20220919092054.png]]
- The block is attached to a horizontal spring and is at rest on a table with 0 friction.
- If we pull the block to the right 1 inch, it would [[oscillate]] - moves back and forth through an [[equilibrium point]] - the point where the force was 0.
- The spring is providing the restoring force, for on every other point along the path of the back and forth motion, the spring would be pushing or pulling the block back toward the equillibrium point.

#### [[Hooke's Law]] - how we can calculate the restorative force #formula 
$$\overrightarrow{F}_{elastic} = -k\overrightarrow{x}$$
Where:
- $\overrightarrow{F}$  is the Restorative Force (N, or Newtons)
- $k$ is the Stiffness Coefficient (N/m)
- $\overrightarrow{x}$  is the Displacement (m)

#### [[The relationship between acceleration, force and displacement in a SHM]]
- The acceleration of the object is directly proportional to the displacement of the object from its equilibrium position.
- The velocity of the object is inversely proportional to the displacementâ€”the further away from the equilibrium point, the smaller the velocity will be.
