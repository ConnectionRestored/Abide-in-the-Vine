Passage: [[2 Cor-12#v1]] - [[2 Cor-12#v10]]

- Do you have any problems or needs that you want for us to pray for?
	- There seems to be an endless streams of problems and hardships!
		- Old Testament: [[Eccles-01#v8]]
		- NT: [[Rom-08#v22]]
	-> We ought to learn to live with our hardships and problems - so that it may not affect our faith, emotions, or even character.

- The passage today gives us help! It explains why there is such a flood - and how we can deal with it.
- Context
	- Paul wrote a letter to the Corinth church, which had great growth and loved the Lord, but Paul can't stay at Corinth (persecution, the need to plant churches). But at Corinth, there are "super-apostles," who claimed that Paul wasn't an apostle (sent from Jesus) - so Paul needs to write a letter and show that he is the real apostle, not to show-off, but to help the Corinth church stay in the truth.
	- In [[2 Corinthians]], Paul gives many reasons to protect his apostleship. 

![[2 Cor-12#v1]]

![[2 Cor-12#v2]]
- In this passage, Paul doesn't want to tell about this experience, but because the context, he had too.
	- "a man" = Paul

[[2 Cor-12#v6]]
- This experience is the "truth."

[[2 Cor-12#v7]]
- "a thorn in the flesh"
	- The reason for this **thorn:** "a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively." -> This **thorn** is so that Paul doesn't become prideful, but instead, rely on God's grace ([[2 Cor-12#v9]]).
		- I am prideful by my sinful nature. I do want to be independent and not rely on God (in my sinful nature).
			- Pride comes from our sinful nature
				- [[Deut-08#v11]] - [[Deut-08#v18]]
					- [[Deut-08#v16]] - **that he might humble you**
					- Israel was travelling in the wilderness, but now Israel is about to enter the Promised Land - a land flowing with milk and honey. God warns the Israelites of their pride - it was not by the Israelites' power and might of their hands that got them this wealth.
				- [[Prov-30#v7]] - [[Prov-30#v9]]
					- A prayer of a "wise men" - who knows the sinful human inclination.
				- Satan's temptation = be independent from God.
		- In parenting, the norm is to teach our children to be independent. Instead, because of this passage, we should teach our children to be *responsible,* but be absolutely dependent on God and on others.
			- The church is a body, made out of "parts" -> we depend on others, but we have our own responsibility.
		- If we live for ourselves, we become individualists - which is horrible!
		- Jesus is our best example
			- [[John-05#v20]] and [[John-05#v30]]
				- Jesus is totally dependent on the Father.
			- [[John-15#v4]]
				- We ought to *remain in the vine* - our else how can we grow? We need to fully dependent upon Jesus, like a branch that remains in the vine.
	- [[2022-10-16]] - 10:18 - God is answering my prayer. I prayed (not literally) for God to humble me, and He is teaching me right now, AMEN!
- There will be flood!
	- Why?
		- Because we are prideful by our sinful nature. Flood comes so that we may learn to be dependent on God.
			- The heart of God: He wants Israel to enter the Promise Land, but He lead Israel through the wilderness so that they may learn to be dependent on Him, while they are in the wilderness and when they enter the Promised Land.
- How do we response?
	- **Try to overcome the problem.**
		- Paul prayed for God for his "thorn" to depart from him, three times and even listened to God's response! And we should do the same.
	- **But sometimes, God won't remove that "thorn."**
		- [[2 Cor-12#v9]]
			- We know our weaknesses, and learn to rely on God's grace.
			- We learn to live by God's grace.
			- When we work, we work fervently, but we work by God's grace, and for God's glory.

Relying on God is beautiful and awesome! Jesus did, and because he did, we ought too. Then, a day will come, we will be delivered from these problems. We don't want a happy life - what? - but we want to live in His eternal Life.

Paul had a vision, and his retelling is true - it is God's Word. But Paul doesn't answer the question: "Did your spirit got taken? Or did it remain in the flesh? Or did your flesh and spirit got taken." But that meant, Heaven - and the new heaven and earth is real. IT IS - or else
